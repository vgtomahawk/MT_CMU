so steve steve , <unk> of the time of los angeles , one day by the streets of los angeles , she was a wonderful music .
she came from a man , a servant , <unk> , bing , <unk> , who woke up a keyboard , only only two explained .
many of you are aware of this story , because in <unk> paper , was a book that was <unk> , <unk> robert <unk> , and <unk> <unk> as a <unk> paul <unk> , the <unk> , who started to <unk> and <unk> <unk> as a <unk> encyclopedia , the <unk> , who started to <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , alex , a <unk> and 30 years later , he was used as a train at the streets of <unk> <unk> .
and i 'm showing you all of the rest of the <unk> , or the movie look at this film , and it 's not just the wonderful connection , that between these two men , or the way that music is able to understand the connection between these two men , but the way that the music has made these relationship with these two men , but how they finally have the instrument , and when they read the instrument , if it 's a <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> ,
i met dr. <unk> <unk> in 2004 , two years ago , in august st. <unk> .
he had just been a clip of <unk> , and the curator robert came to the stage to read me .
he spoke in a very <unk> and <unk> of all ages , and israel clinton and talking about how scripture did n't get into the <unk> world , and all of this is because of all of the <unk> <unk> of the last sentence of <unk> king .
and we went to talk to me , and a few days later , i got a email where i was thinking about a <unk> that i was doing .
i also had to say that apple had a medical treatment , because he was already with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and a smart person who got his entire life .
as a result of it , though , it 's particularly useful for those of us , and that 's sometimes as bad , and it 's asleep , in the streets of <unk> <unk> , and this is the <unk> of his own mind .
and in fact , in a very funny room , it was <unk> , when we were talking with our first day , at the university of california , declan , and he had this mad filter in his eyes and lost it .
he was talking about invisible athletes and smoke and talking about how someone wants to leave to sleep .
i did n't know , i could remember , but i was afraid that i could get to lose him , that he could be able to be able to be able to lose him in a relationship with his neck , and that i could imagine him with his relationship to a psychologist , if i started to talk about <unk> and <unk> and other <unk> practices .
so i started trying to play .
i played the first sentence of <unk> <unk> .
and as i was doing , i started to see that in <unk> eyes , a lot of change .
it was as if he was <unk> by the power of his science , a chemical response to be a game .
<unk> <unk> bone marrow began to find out , in a quiet curiosity ,
and as a miracle , he took his neck , and started to listen to some of these seeming signs of <unk> , and asked me to play her ,
and so we started to talk about music , starting from all of a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and all the other creeds , from <unk> to <unk> .
and i realized that he did n't just have a knowledge of music , but it took me to get a tight personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding of my colleagues in the conferences of los angeles .
when he was doing music , and over the time , there was this <unk> , <unk> man , who was still in the streets of los angeles .
music is medicine . music makes us .
it 's music to be <unk> health .
because the music allows him to read his thoughts and control with his imagination and creativity .
and so he <unk> his <unk> .
i understood that exactly the nature of art .
this is the reason why we do music : this is how we can do it in all of us , so , in our sense , our feelings , through our evolutionary metabolism , through our creativity .
and the most important thing is to us all of us , and the way that we 've done , we 're inspired ,
and so , as a <unk> , this led to the music back into a community of friends .
the <unk> force of the music he took him back in a family of al gore , who helped him think he was able to take a talent and helped him .
and i 'm always going to be able to do with him , if you can talk to yourself , if you do n't know if i 'm going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
thank you very much .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
<unk> se .
robert gallo : i want to play a little bit i 'm going to <unk> the <unk> .
i hope you guys .
so i have a lot of fish in many life .
i just have a love .
this first , that was more than a grateful .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good , <unk> , a castle on the apartments .
this is a fish .
so better , he was used to <unk> the highest risk of sustainability .
so you could feel feeling to sell it .
i had with this beauty a few months .
and one day , the head of a company , and asked if i was talking about a gentleman in the farm .
`` of course , i said .
so this was a company that was trying to solve what this needed for our iphones , how do we train fish ?
in the last 50 years , we 've got the oceans where we have tropical <unk> .
it 's hard to visualize the destruction .
<unk> percent of the big fish that we love , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , they 're protected .
it 's almost nothing left .
so , whether or be <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
a lot of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> the environment , most of them , and they are resilient , so we 're <unk> .
he has a <unk> from chicago .
that means , for a hundred pounds of organs , you need to be a pound controller .
not very sustainable .
does n't sound very good .
so , finally , a company who was trying to do it .
i wanted to get them .
at the day of the event , i called the head of the <unk> for the company .
let 's read him .
`` mommy , '' i said , `` only about the facts are right , you 're famous , so far outside the sea , that you have to know the environment . ''
`` the right thing , he says . `` we are so far outside the <unk> of our fish , not jealous . ''
and then he <unk> it , `` we are basically a whole world .
this is <unk> from the bookstore .
`` the best in the business . ''
<unk> to a great , great .
`` <unk> , right ? what 's your quality ? ''
`` carbon proteins , '' he said .
`` great , '' i said .
and on this evening , i was in bed in my bed , and i thought , `` what is hell ?
so i called the next day , short of the event , painting .
i said , `` well , what do you know ? <unk> <unk> ? ''
he said he does n't . he 's gon na say .
well , i 'm going to talk to a couple of people in the company ; nobody could give me a <unk> response . so i finally decided to talk to the <unk> biologists .
let 's also call it again .
`` aah , '' i said , `` what is about <unk> proteins ? ''
well , he said some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , `` <unk> ? ''
he said , `` yes , temperature , skin , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . ''
i said , `` how much oil of the <unk> is a gun ? ''
in the assumption , maybe two percent .
`` well , that 's about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , `` daddy , what 's useful for him chicken ? ''
there was a long time in the world , and he said , `` there is easy to come out there . ''
i <unk> myself .
no , not , because i 'm a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
this is me .
no , i 've been <unk> out of this fish , because i 'm talking about god , the fish for him .
this second fish , which is another kind of <unk> .
it 's the romantic way , the way you get to get your fish , you take the fish .
i met it in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> boy had been interested in a long time .
it 's actually <unk> us .
he came up on a table , almost <unk> white color .
he gave him <unk> .
<unk> twice .
he was still delicious .
who can make a fish like that , who he was <unk> ?
i can not do it , but this guy can .
let 's celebrate him . in fact , it 's called google .
and no , he does n't have the fish , and it 's not a chef . at the way you understand , and i understand them .
he 's a biologist at <unk> de <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner .
it 's over the <unk> of the river .
in the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of <unk> .
they were <unk> <unk> on what they discovered .
they did this by turning the land .
they built these little <unk> of chemotherapy , and they would take water out of the land ,
well , they could n't help that this was not sustainable .
and security is a catastrophe .
it took about 90 percent of the birds , which is a few birds .
and so , again , a <unk> company with the country .
what did they do ?
they have the <unk> of the water .
they literally <unk> the <unk> .
instead of the water <unk> , they used to <unk> the water .
they <unk> the <unk> .
they created a <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and they have breast cancer , and his company with the tropical destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you 've never seen anything .
and you 're looking at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see is <unk> <unk> ,
i did n't have a long time ago .
he 's a huge guy , three parts charles charles and no part ,
okay ? so , we were talking about , and we went through the wounds , and we were <unk> and <unk> , put it up with my heads , and hans <unk> in a <unk> .
this is what he is wearing a rare <unk> .
now he 's going to keep the <unk> of eden .
and here , there 's a pattern that brings him to the <unk> .
it turns out that breast , the largest part of his career in the national park in africa .
i asked him how he got to be a <unk> .
he said , `` fish ? i do n't know about fish .
i 'm an expert for relationships . ''
and then it goes , and it 's going to be <unk> by more birds and sisters .
and do n't get me wrong , that 's really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community , in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was <unk> about this <unk> piece of <unk> that i did .
so , i got it to me . i said , `` rachel , how did you get your fish ? ''
he showed up with the algae .
`` i know , boy , the algae , the <unk> , that is incredible .
but what do your blood pressure ?
how is the <unk> ? ''
now , he told me to tell you that it is so much , that the fish eat what they eat in the wild .
the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , which is what the fish is .
the system is so healthy , it 's completely <unk> .
there is no food .
who 's heard about a farm that does n't mean ?
now , after the day , i went on this piece of gloves , and i asked him , i said , `` well , how much as a place i was , `` how did you learn ? ''
in the moment , it was when a <unk> person had to offer you .
and we put on the corner and we looked at the beginning of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands , and it 's so sharp .
`` that 's success , '' he said .
`` look at your bellies , pink .
they 're <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was totally confused .
i said , `` did you know your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> the birds .
now , last year , at this dialogue , 300 birds , more than 1.2 different kinds of different species .
it 's the largest and one of the most successful private fund in europe .
i said , `` greg , '' is that the last person you have to have in a bookstore ? ''
he tasted his head , no .
he said , `` we 're building <unk> .
this is a major network .
the eiffel harvest the <unk> .
the shopkeepers eat the <unk> .
so the phoenix islands is the system . ''
okay , let 's look at this . a farm that does n't interact with their genes , and a farm that connects us in their health care .
a <unk> , but a <unk> .
oh , and of course , not just tearing that miscarriage .
they breed in a city of 140 kilometers , where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning you go to 60 miles .
and every night , they 're about 12,000 miles .
they do it because they can be the <unk> white of the <unk> .
in fact .
and i was looking at a sort of journey of the penguins , so i looked at .
i said , `` bill , come on 4,000 miles to come in and forth ? ''
do you do it for the kids ? ''
he looked at me when i was a song from david <unk> .
he said , `` no . you make it because the food is better . ''
i did n't have the skin of my dog 's , and i 'm not a <unk> . i do n't know her .
it 's this <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
i just never heard it .
and yet , when i was trying to do it in this restaurant , you did n't have to <unk> her <unk> .
they felt cute , and it would be like if you put a drop of the ocean .
i mentioned that for him , and he recommends .
he said , `` the skin looks like a glass .
it 's the last mile before it 's in the body .
it has evolved in the <unk> of the <unk> . ''
and then he <unk> up , `` but our water has no <unk> . ''
okay . a farm that kills their fish . a farm that brings us to <unk> them from success .
and then i realized , when he says , a farm that 's not <unk> , it 's kind of <unk> water , because the water that comes through this farm .
it 's a river , which is all the things that are communicating to the animal , but it 's used to be chemical <unk> , solar panels .
and when it comes through the system , and it 's the water b , as it is <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not in a farm that does n't use their animals , not only a farm that is literally a <unk> , and not only for those fish , but it 's not only for those fish .
because when the water is <unk> , it 's in the atlantic .
a leader in the ocean , i know , but i 'm going to take it , and that 's what you want to do , because these <unk> , like <unk> is always .
you could say that it 's a recipe for the future , whether we 're talking about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food also well .
but for many people , it 's a little bit of action .
we 're not <unk> ; we 're <unk> . we 're <unk> .
we love <unk> . we love small <unk> . we love about local food .
and if you 're saying that , things are the future 's good job , somebody wakes up , and says , `` hey people , i love the world war , but how are you going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? ''
can i be honest ?
i do n't like this question .
no , not , because we have enough calories to create more than just .
one billion people will talk about death .
one billion -- this is more than ever before -- because the <unk> delta in the distribution , not the <unk> .
well , i do n't like this question because it 's the logic of our world 's last 50 years .
so , onscreen movements in <unk> , <unk> on the ground , google , <unk> , and the whole time , we have a chance to stop the kaaba , `` why can possibly be ? ''
this was the <unk> . it was the power .
what we should call is what is it is , in a <unk> , a <unk> , that 's because of the production .
this is not a leap , it 's not agriculture .
our <unk> is today , not because <unk> <unk> , but from <unk> resources .
not <unk> by the newest <unk> and <unk> , but by british land , not by flapping water , but by the water , and not by <unk> and water , but through fish .
they want to feed the world ?
let 's start with the question : how do we feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create the basis that make a community for themselves ?
to do that , look at the <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's gone .
education , chemistry and machines are in the <unk> , and it 's never really good for food .
let 's look at the <unk> model .
this is the equivalent of two billion years .
look for smallpox , farmers like google .
narrator , these are not the worlds for adults , companies , who are trying to cure drugs , drugs , the <unk> , rather than <unk> , who are not just connected , but experts for relationships .
because they are these people who are experts .
and when i 'm really honest , you 're a better treat when i 'm ever .
you know , that 's what i 'm right , because when the future is good .
thank you .
now , if i want to do one of the time , it 's the power of the data that we have to be bigger than the sum of your senses and instead of trying to think about how to make information as well as we can make information so much that we can use information as well as we can make information as well as we can make information as well as we can use information .
so what 's what we see is a <unk> <unk> for old age .
so the program that i use here is a little experiment .
it 's called <unk> , and what i can do with <unk> is that i can use it to a certain set of what we call .
and then i look at a pattern , and this is what you see .
and that is because in the <unk> of the people here , and they are over there .
we can take a step back and zoom in the data , and look at the data , and it 's almost camouflaged , and it 's not for everyone .
now , if we 're going to continue to work , for example , we 'll be 40 years , or we see 40 years or so we can see that the laws is going to be talking about the people .
and that <unk> shows that it 's particularly interesting to men .
so you can see that look at information , and data in this kind of urine in a pile of <unk> .
and if we can do this for information , why ca n't matter for content ?
now , what we 've done here is the <unk> of every single woman called the <unk> <unk> that have ever been put together .
it 's all right . it 's all the online .
you can try to talk to my talk .
you can buy it in a decade .
you can peel on a particular year .
you can read directly to a certain show .
now , when i look at here , i see the athlete that look inside this palette .
i 'm a regular <unk> of this , so i 'm going to show you all of the buttons in which i 'm going to show myself in my mind .
now , if i want to make a <unk> of this , i could say , ok , what do i do with the subject ? ''
so i 'm going to take a step back and <unk> it .
now , i see 55,000 <unk> .
and so you get a idea of that , if you get on this kind of information , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you wo n't just sit or <unk> .
you do something that 's actually a bit different .
it 's something between , and we think it changes the way .
now , i want to leave this idea of what 's a little bit crazy .
what we 've done here is , we 've created every single light bulb , and it has contributed to a small level .
and the only one is a quick visualization and a symbol for the area of it .
i 'm just going to take the top 500 million of the <unk> .
but even in this demonstration , we can do a lot of things .
and then we get a sense of the issues that are based on wikipedia .
so i 'm going to argue the theme of a magician .
now , after i mentioned <unk> , i know that the <unk> of which is the most vulnerable , most of the year .
this is really important because it 's a realization that is not in a single <unk> .
that 's just to see if you take a step and look at the whole time .
recently on a certain of the <unk> , i can see in the subject of the year of the year , and all of you .
now , if i look at all of these people , i know that the majority of you are there , the majority of science , and some of the science is , i 've got to do this , and it 's my head .
and interestingly , a ted teacher won .
so we can read and look at all ted talks .
you see , if you look at the web , the first time you see is the internet , not only from the side , but it 's much more .
and so i 'd like to show you what a little surprise .
so i 'm going to show you now just the new york times .
<unk> , this method -- i do n't want to be a browser ; it 's really not a browser ; it 's really not a browser , but you can call the <unk> to each other software .
so , i can go back to you , and i 'm looking at a similar <unk> .
so this is really important because you can just look through the <unk> of music in the way that you can look at the same way .
so , i can zoom in my initial slides .
here 's the <unk> of the whole thing i 've been doing .
and i can take it all i 've been working on today .
and so , if i take a step forward , and i can look at anything , i can find my studies today , and i 'm going to talk to myself , i 'm going to talk to myself , for example , or i 'm going to speak at <unk> .
and that 's what i 'm going to come back in front of you .
it 's a metaphor that 's going to happen again , and every time it makes the whole range of bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
right now , in this world , we think the data is a garden .
we talk about the <unk> of the <unk> .
we 're talking about opec 's information .
what if we could activate this situation , and the internet on the head is that we can go from a little bit , we have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do a lot of things , and so , what is a tenor of hopelessness ?
if we can do this , this process is going to be able to create this kind of building information for a different source .
and , instead of trying to move into information , we can learn from it .
and if we know , if we can understand , we can even educate .
that 's what i hear .
i grew up with a <unk> scientific science .
in my hometown , i went to school , every day every hour .
and my nose continued always in a book , a <unk> , who loves my thoughts in other worlds , and in my sense , my <unk> in my life , i think , <unk> curiosity .
this curiosity , however , that i was always when i was not in school , by the forests of the <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and blood and <unk> and everything in the microscope .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it 's all about trying to understand the world and the boundaries of the mistakes .
and my love to science fiction was in my neighborhood , because at the late '60s , i went to the moon , and we have the deep sea .
paul maccready came in our living room with his extraordinary <unk> that we 've been able to communicate and animals and places that we had never imagined before .
this is what it looks like this is <unk> .
and i was artists .
i could read . i could play .
and i do n't want to play video games with these <unk> <unk> with <unk> films , and so the whole mathematics in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
so we had to do this . if we had a book , we were able to take a book , and we had the description of the <unk> and gave them on the screen in our heads .
my response was , and the absence of the lack of worlds , religious worlds , robots , and things like this .
in the middle , i was always touched by the teacher , i think , in the middle of my shirt .
the creativity had to be stopped .
and what 's happening is something interesting , and what was looking at me about the <unk> <unk> , it was a very natural world in our world itself .
certainly , i would never get a <unk> world with a <unk> , so that seemed to me .
but this is a world that i 've been able to read here on the earth , and she was able to find the most beautiful and curious about all the things that i 've been able to read this books .
so i decided when i was 15 .
the only problem i was in a small village in canada , one meter from the next sea .
but i did n't cry .
i called my father , until it was working on a <unk> farm in new york city , new york city , where we lived .
i took my <unk> in a library of <unk> in the middle of winter in the middle of the middle of the middle of winter , new york .
but the ocean , however , we have two years later , when we went to california .
in fact , in the 40 years , i 've spent about 20 hours of water , 500 hours of it .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the <unk> ocean , is so many of the life is how we really can imagine .
it 's not our boundaries of nature , especially in spite of our own self-interest of human imagination .
and at the time of time , i 'm listening to the buddha of what i see on my <unk> .
and my love to the ocean is the same intensity as well .
so when i was as an adult , it was the <unk> .
so this was the best opportunity to read my inner job , stories to help me to create images .
as a child , i was always talking about it , and so .
so , the movies were pictures and pictures and stories about this .
of course , the stories that i gave me from the <unk> : `` <unk> , '' and `` <unk> . ''
so in `` <unk> , '' i used to try and write the <unk> for the <unk> ,
so my new passions takes me .
so , what 's interesting is about <unk> , to create a <unk> problem in this film -- and we had to do so we had a kind of <unk> <unk> -- so we went to <unk> animation .
and what was happening , the first cloned <unk> that had seen in a movie .
now the movie did n't have a robot , right , he was just going to be able to look at his <unk> , but i found something fascinating : the audience on the world , as <unk> from the sound of this .
according to islam , however , is <unk> technology , and it is not more than any other .
so they saw something beautiful .
and that was what i became incredibly exciting .
and i thought , `` wow , that 's got to be in the wheels . ''
so , we went to a <unk> , my next film , a lot .
together with stained selection , we gave the guy out of liquid , there 's about how this effect came up .
and it worked , again , we had something magical , and the difference in the audience was the same thing , but we 've been working with the movie a little bit of money .
so , in these two experiences , a new world has been a new world of creativity .
so i sat in a company , and with my friend friend <unk> <unk> , who was on the time of the best <unk> and <unk> . it was `` <unk> . ''
and the idea of this company was , which is the end of the <unk> and <unk> and forth with digital equipment .
and so we did it , and we 're trying to do it for a while .
but in the 1990s , we did know that we were in the <unk> and <unk> -- which we actually had to do the company , we 've been working on to slowly .
and i had this piece called `` yes '' written by the <unk> of the new haven , '' <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> should be all <unk> .
but the centerline of it was very late . and the people in my company said that we would not be able to build this together .
so , i went to , and i saw this other film about the big ship , which is happening .
the <unk> i was like , `` <unk> and juliet morning on a ship , '' it was a <unk> <unk> , a funny film .
however , i wanted to find the real barrier of the titanic .
that 's what i did .
this is the truth . the studio did n't .
i did it , and i decided to say , `` we go to the supermarket . we stop the answer .
we 'll show it in the <unk> of the movie .
this is important . it 's a good <unk> for marketing . ''
and i <unk> her , a big deal .
it 's crazy . but that 's back to the back of the back of the real imagination .
and i built this six months later , i think , in fact , i think , in fact , i think , in fact , a lot of reality , where i was in a russian team , four kilometers under the surface of the north pole , and i saw the real titanic through a <unk> .
that was not a movie , no <unk> , that was real .
so that 's what i really did .
and the most important thing we have had to do , and we had to take cameras and build and everything else .
and i noticed , how much these <unk> , a <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
you go into these efforts , you get into the dark , remote environments , where you can not do it yourself .
and i thought , `` wow , that 's the same time when i was in a <unk> .
that 's really cool . ''
i was curious about the study of the deep sea .
anyway , in the part of the good and science , it was all about it .
and it was a experience that gave me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could make a visual effect , but i could n't be able to imagine what i could see outside of the <unk> .
now , some of the things that i found out in the meantime , and sometimes the things that i had never seen before , as well , things that had never seen before , and i think they saw them , i do n't have any words .
so that 's what i was doing , and i wanted to do more .
and so i ended up a little bit .
after the success of the titanic , i said , `` okay , i want to give my <unk> as a filmmaker , '' in hollywood , and i would say goodbye for a while . ''
and then we started , we called the <unk> , and we got them with <unk> .
and we went to the top of the titanic .
we used little robot that we had built into a <unk> .
our intent was , <unk> , and look at the back of the back of what had been done before .
no one ever had the inside of the <unk> . you had no idea of doing it . so we had the transition technology .
well , and so , i 'm looking at the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and look at the <unk> , which is a little bit like me , and i know that once the band is completed .
and i read with a little <unk> of the <unk> of the ship .
i 'm actually suggesting that , but my consciousness is within the computer .
it felt like when i was living in the <unk> of the titanic .
this was the <unk> form of a <unk> that i 've ever seen . because before i went on a corner , i was always looking at what was happening on the edge of the knee , because i was in the <unk> .
and the one that was the exact <unk> of the <unk> .
so that was a very useful experience .
and it made me to realize that , you know , using these <unk> , that you can use these <unk> behaviors , and so the power of your consciousness in the vehicle , in these other forms of existence .
it was really deeply efficient .
and perhaps a little bit reminiscent of what could happen in some decades , if you 've got to have something to find something , or other things , in all sorts of things that i can imagine .
so , at this point , we started to think about what we saw on the bottom , we 've got to look at these <unk> , where we saw this incredibly complex animals . that 's sort of <unk> , but here .
they live with stories .
they do n't exist in a <unk> system as we do .
and so that 's where you can find animals right now as a high rate , you can survive there .
at the same time , i was very interested in <unk> , that was the <unk> of my childhood .
and so , i went on to people who have been interested in space , and the people talk about , and i 'm going to do with the <unk> , and i think , on the mission , the <unk> of the <unk> , and then on the international <unk> and our decisions .
this is fascinating .
but at the end , it turned out that i was <unk> with the <unk> valley .
and i took them with them , and i put them into the world , because of course , <unk> , people who were punished for these <unk> situations , and i took them through the sources of their antigens , and take them back to their <unk> , and so forth .
we were <unk> , but actually , science , really , science , <unk> .
so the circle between my existence as nursing as a child , and the opportunities in the reality .
in the meantime , i 've learned a lot .
i have a lot about science , but i think there can be a writer , a leader , like a <unk> , or so .
i do n't mind myself , but i do n't think of myself , before i do that .
because in a particular point , i had to say , `` what do i do ?
why do i do that ? what 's going on ? ''
this is that little <unk> do n't help us .
we 're just obeying the <unk> , and we 're not going to get out of air .
all right , i think between the titanic , and i said , `` compromise , '' and `` lean '' or `` '' and `` i 'm going to go on a piece of the beach . ''
i 've all made this films , this leak , for a very small audience .
no ear , no way , no money . what do you do ?
you 're doing it to the challenge , and the ocean is the <unk> environment , and because of the strange connection , which means when a small group of people have a team .
because we 've got all this with only 10 to 12 people that we know , we 've got two to three months .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing that you can imagine , because you have a task , you can not do something else .
and if you go to land , and you say , `` you know , i said , `` we 've got to do , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the whole thing that human beings , if you look at the holidays , you can not be able to look at the other hand , and that 's what 's going on in the morning , and you can not know the other hand , and that 's what 's going on in the morning , and you can never find the other .
there 's a connection , a giraffe .
so when i went back to my next film , `` trust , '' i decided to use the same kind of task that you use his team ,
this is really changed .
so , i said , with a small team on <unk> , we were called `` avatar '' with a new technology that would n't be before .
very exciting .
a huge challenge .
and we 've got for a hundred and a half million years .
it changed my way to make movies .
there were people who thought that we were able to do this <unk> , really well , and it was <unk> .
for me , it was a more important way to do my job , the real process that has changed in .
so what can we do about all this ?
what did we learn ?
i think the first place is gratefulness .
it 's the most important human property .
our language is a power that even even have a reality .
and the bleaching of the team is more important than all the world .
so to me , young <unk> , who says , `` give me a minute i can do . ''
and i say , `` do n't tell you .
the wires are other for you . do n't tell you all , you do n't care about .
nasa did n't have a <unk> , `` asshead is not a disaster . ''
but in the art and the other hand , there is also an alternative , because there is a <unk> .
no big deal with innovation , which innovation is invented a lot .
you have to be willing to take these risks .
this is the idea that i want to leave you with . it 's a alternative , scared , yes .
today i 'm talking to you about energy and climate .
and it 's something that might be something like this , because my favorite therapist work on the foundation , and you can also find the things that we create , and you need to build the poorest two billion dollars .
but energy and climate are incredibly important for these people , because most importantly , as opposed to each other .
<unk> means that their <unk> are often about a few years , not , we can do a lot of them , or not necessarily a lot of time , the things that are going to be able to achieve their neurologic environment .
it leads to uncertainty .
so , it 's a great curiosity for them .
and also , it 's also really important for them .
the fact is that if you 're only from one of the price , it would be the energy of the energy system .
now the <unk> is about the time .
in fact , it 's actually <unk> 's <unk> .
the <unk> of the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a <unk> case in the <unk> , and so we have <unk> materials and so many things .
so we are in a wonderful view of electricity in the rich world .
but , if we get the price , we 're going to take the price in a million star , and that proportion to each other .
co2 is the planet and the equation for co2 is actually pretty simple .
and they <unk> the <unk> roots , which is the <unk> , and the <unk> has some very negative effects of the weather and perhaps worse , the <unk> , that the natural ecosystems can not access to the <unk> , and the whole systems come .
well , the same boat between a <unk> , and the source of the nest maintenance workers and where their patients have a result , there are some non-linear organizations , but not very many .
and there 's certainly <unk> about how bad these will be . but they 're extremely bad .
so , we 've been asking the <unk> long , `` do we need to go down to zero ?
is n't half of time or a living ? ''
the answer is , until we go to zero , the temperature goes on .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's all different to us , we have a <unk> long high truck , which has to come up at a three feet in front of them .
this is to go to zero .
well , we 're going to spend a bunch of carbon dioxide from about 12,000 billion tons .
every americans spends about 20 tons of people from poor countries , less than one .
in the average , it 's about five tons for each other .
and somehow , we need to use changes in zero .
it 's so fast .
now , we have different economic changes , and we have to get rid of <unk> toxins , and we have to mobilize poverty .
this equation has four rules , a little bit of carbon , and you have this thing on the planet , co2 -- that you can do with zero to each other , the average energy for every drug , the average energy for every drug and the co2 .
so , let 's take each of a matter of time , and we think we 're going to do it in zero .
now , you have to get a look at a lot of zero .
now this is the <unk> , but let 's go .
we first have the population .
today , 2.1 billion people .
and it leads to nine billion , which is to live on nine billion .
if we 're very successful with new regimes , the <unk> and <unk> , we could do this for 10 percent to 40 percent , but at the time , we see a slope of recovery .
the second factor are the fuel we use .
this is all about food that we eat , clothing , tv .
these are very good things , and that means that they 're getting paid for the planet .
it 's great that this number is going .
in the developing world , in the upper city , we could take it more and more likely to do that , but in the average , that number one year every year , and it will be more than two , the average need to be a product .
what we see here is a very <unk> service . it 's at the light that you can read the homework ?
and these students have n't , so you go and read your <unk> under the <unk> .
now , in retrospect , the e , the energy per mile , there is good news .
we have something that does n't happen .
there 's a lot of different successes in the <unk> , with other forms of new methods , there are a lot of lentils to attract their money around 90 percent .
in other domains , as a result of <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> or the <unk> or the <unk> or <unk> , or the legs for work very much smaller .
in fact , if we 're optimistic , we will have a choice for three or maybe even a factor .
but in the first three factors , we are now talking about 26 billion pounds , and that 's not surprising .
so , in fact , we have the fourth factor -- and this is a <unk> -- this is the amount of co2 , which is a continuous commodity .
it turns out that if you can do that .
if you get coal , no .
if you do n't have natural gas : no .
almost every <unk> for electricity , all of these areas are co2 , except for renewables .
so , what we need to do is to do for a global level is to create a new system .
we need collusion .
now , when i say the word `` god , '' i do n't understand .
it 's a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and it 's a miracle .
the people here were involved in many of these miracles .
normally , though , there 's no shortcut that you need to be a miracle to a certain degree .
normally you are just looking at the top of your life , and you can not look at it .
so in this case , we have to be <unk> , and a miracle for a long time .
well , i thought , how could i do that ?
is there a natural way , a evidence that the idea of people here ?
i feel like last year , when i was doing , and i always liked the people .
the idea was really important , you know , there are people who were working on .
for energy , this is what i was doing .
and i decided that the <unk> of drugs would be the <unk> of the environment .
so here 's a few natural candles .
you know , you know , you know , they 're told you , but you 're not going to be <unk> .
well , there are all sorts of notes like this , but they do n't own all .
we need a lot of solutions , either one or a whole lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of value , and more importantly , and even though there 's a lot of places that people think about , in fact , we can only have five years that can make it a lot better .
i have <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
and there 's a profound contribution , and if you want to be better than i expect , the great thing , but my integrity here is that we have to work on all of the five work , and we can not understand from them .
now , if we look at the top of fossil fuels , the <unk> of our plants or natural gas .
what you need to do is perhaps just , but that 's not . you need to take all the co2 that come up to the <unk> , you know , through pressure , and then sit there .
there is a few decades that are used for a $ 50 percent -- 80 percent of it , but it 's too hard to be easy . and a chance to be able to be a very important challenge .
who will use it ?
who can play something out of what has been many different times bigger than any kind of starbucks that you can learn from clusters and other things ?
that 's a lot of time .
so this is a tough <unk> .
next , <unk> .
now , the whole lot of problems , the cost of all , in the world , in many countries , high seas in the world , in the world , the amount of certainty that you can do n't even feel secure , despite the human activity , which is not sustainable .
and what do you do with that ?
because even though it 's not very big , there 's a lot of view .
so three and more important problems that are machines are , and that they should be .
the last three of the five days i 've done .
it 's called renewables as they 're called .
and , of course , even though it 's not , they have no force -- they have some clues .
one is the <unk> that creates these technologies that are used as much as a <unk> .
these are <unk> , you know from many <unk> , 1,000 times as a normal power .
now , these are these tools to use these sources .
the sun does n't seem like all day , and it does n't matter every day , and the synapses that they do n't have the wind .
and so , you have to get out of these sources , a way that you can do , but it is n't available .
so , there are big <unk> . there are challenges in brazil . if we say that the energy outside the country is , they do n't only have the technology , they have to be the technology for the risk that the energy of all .
and there 's the <unk> .
and to use the dimension , i have all of these kinds of devices that you have to do : the problem with cars , computers like computers , computers , computers , mobile phones , <unk> , whatever .
so we need to be a big breakthrough here , something that is going to be a factor of a better than the probability of time .
it 's not impossible , but it 's not so easy .
this is , when you try to take these <unk> miles away , we 'll spend 20 percent -- 30 percent of the earth .
if you want to spend 100 percent of it , you need a incredible <unk> .
now where are we going to say , what is the right approach ?
a `` third project '' like , how do we go ?
what we need is a lot of companies who are working on .
in each of these five domains , we need to spend 100 years .
so , you 'll tell you , you 're crazy ! that 's good .
i think there are many people who are there there .
bill 's got a lot of companies , among other words , a great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invest in dozens of thousands of great things , and interesting things , and i 'm trying to support that .
nathan myhrvold and i 'm going to be a company that , perhaps , without the lack of approach .
there are some innovations in the <unk> ; amp ; d .
so the development is in this industry , a few years ago , so it 's not a big surprise , some of us are good .
the <unk> means that you 're going to use one of the <unk> , which is one percent , the <unk> , we decided to reduce the 99 percent to fuel .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , in fact , you have a little bit about it , but you could never look closely with it , but it could n't look like marilyn , you know , but there was modern radiation , you can see it , you know , because there were modern war , you can see it .
and because you see that 99 percent matter , it is very much better .
in fact , you can get the <unk> of today , and you can also get the <unk> of animals .
instead of looking at the head , get it . a great thing .
the tailings ponds will be used as a paddle .
you can see it 's a kind of <unk> , often as a wave of it .
this is really the <unk> .
this is a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the <unk> , which is 99 percent . you have the part of which today , so it 's called corrupt <unk> .
this is the united states for hundreds of years .
and if you 're <unk> <unk> , and just <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there 's a lot of challenges , but it 's an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move .
let 's think about how to measure our success .
what would our <unk> look like ?
now , let 's go up to the target we need to do , and we 'll talk about the <unk> .
a lot of about 80 percent reduction in 2050 .
it 's really important to us .
the rest of 20 percent are going to be rich in poor countries , and it 's going to be <unk> , and it 's going to be <unk> .
so , to do this 80 percent reduction , the world , including countries like china , their lowest score .
the other note says , if we can use the <unk> technology , whether it 's in all the countries , and we are on the rest .
that 's great .
this is a key to this proposition .
now , if we go back there , what would we look at the sun ?
it should be the two elements .
we should use the <unk> , to use the way to use the way that we need to be <unk> , the less likely to be <unk> , and it could be the temperature .
but in fact , this is for the things that we 're using companies that are not entirely to the big <unk> , only in the same , or even more important than the other aspect of innovation .
this drone has to have to protect us with <unk> , and that 's why we can measure .
there are many great books in this topic .
the al gore 's book , `` david <unk> , '' `` david <unk> <unk> the earth . ''
it 's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do that , because we need to be <unk> by all sides .
there 's a couple of time .
this is a wish .
a very ambitious desire to make this technology .
if you just have a wish for the next 50 years , i could take the president , a <unk> , and i love this desire , which is , the <unk> , you can not be able to do this desire , the <unk> , or you can not be able to do this desire , i 'm going to be able to do that desire , which is , <unk> <unk> .
this has the biggest impact .
now , if we do n't think about this desire , it will be between 400 and a half million people , between the u.s. and china , and in almost all the lives of the two billion things are very small .
so what do we have to do ?
so what do i do ?
we need to keep ourselves for more .
now , when countries go in places like <unk> , they should not only talk about co2 .
and you would want to talk about these <unk> , and they were going to be <unk> by the <unk> , kind of , you know , for these <unk> ,
we need <unk> , carbon <unk> , <unk> & amp ; d it 's something that a <unk> system .
we have to accelerate the message .
we need to make a lot of <unk> and <unk> , and the things that come up by the government .
it 's an important wish , but i think we can .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you .
thank you very much for us to do something better -- exactly , can you have an idea of the content of this investment ?
bill gates : so the simulation on a mammogram , all the scientists scientists have done , and what we 've done is only a few million .
and the hard step step is , the hard step is to create a billion billions of time , the <unk> and the location of the world of the world .
when the first step is , when it 's like , we 're all right now , because the innovation , the <unk> , as well as we know it .
so to understand this is : what does it work out in the ground , how much clustering of nuclear power nuclear power , and then starts to see the process and go back to the bottom ?
bg : so , all right now , so you have to get rid of the sand , so many people , you have a lot of people who are going to go , and that 's where you can throw it , and things like , or whatever .
now , if you 're very cheap , you can take it for 60 years , you think of a wall -- that she 's able to get a whole bunch of rules .
and it 's sitting there , and it 's <unk> , and it 's gone .
a nuclear weapon that keeps us a solution to the reef .
bg : yeah . so what 's going on to the cloud : you can take it -- there 's a lot of damage with this method -- and then you take it into the next space .
and we 're looking for through the <unk> that we 've done in this <unk> or <unk> in the circulation . this is our <unk> .
so this is what it 's been a problem , and what we 've done in our face , and it 's created by the process of the process .
but while they share with different people in the world .
where is the biggest interest in this way .
bg : well , we have n't been on a place , and there 's a lot more interesting <unk> for all of this company in the name ; there are big interest , and the people of the company were in afghanistan , india , china -- i was here in the world , and i 'm talking about the <unk> .
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and the teacher has done something .
this is an architect one thing that was done .
this is a big step forward , but it 's like a faster and a lot of countries , and so many of them is built , so , every one , every single one for the first one .
in the idea , for the way , a lot of a chance to live in life ?
bg : now we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we 've got 20 years to be <unk> and then 20 years .
this is the <unk> that we have to do the <unk> that we need to communicate .
and , you know , <unk> , if all of good matter , and that 's a big wish , that 's easy .
and luckily , there are dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of thousands of companies that are capable , for the evolution that work for their industry , for example .
and it would be in the best if there 's a pair of information , because then you could use a mixture .
in any case , we need a solution .
does the number of gamers , is this the biggest you know ?
bg : a <unk> is the <unk> .
it would also be without the <unk> , but it 's so much more important .
there are other <unk> companies .
you know , we do n't know these work like this , but there 's the <unk> method that is a different approach .
now , there 's a spectacular <unk> , which is something very difficult , but maybe that 's what it seems about us .
and so , there are different , but the beauty of this is a million times a lot of energy as a , and how if you can deal with the problems , and the <unk> , the best thing , so the impact on the country and other things , almost in a chimpanzee .
if does n't it , then ?
do we need to pull ourselves out to try and try to try to throw out of it ?
bg : if you go into that situation , it 's like if you 've done a lot of time , and before you get a heart attack , what do you do ? you need a <unk> or something .
there 's a <unk> increase in the <unk> , which is linked to various techniques to protect the warming , so that we spend 20 or 30 years to protect us .
this is just a <unk> .
you know that we do n't need it .
some people say they 're not going to work with the insurance , because you might not think about it , because you know it 's a <unk> increase .
i do n't know whether it 's smart , if you have the importance of this problem , but there 's a discourse in <unk> about what you want to do , if the things grow up , or that innovation has to be more than us .
rg : have you a new or two sentences for you to offer them ?
bg : well , unfortunately , life is the <unk> in many different .
the ones , the scientific dots , are very little .
do you tell you think it 's negative effects that do things exist ?
there 's very , very few things that you can tell you about who have a chance in a million .
and this is like this in the same as the adult .
you make the mistake .
and so , the idea is , today , if you 're all different types of problems , where you 've got to do , and that comes to the fact that the federal government does n't want to be , and that 's what it does n't want to look like , and that 's what the human genome is not just the worst part of the world , and say , okay .
the fact is that this makes us worry about .
but my dream here is that , if you can do it , you can do it , but it 's going to be carbon , and i 'm so afraid that says , `` okay , it does n't work out , but i 'm almost afraid , because it 's cheaper than the final method . ''
and this would be their answer to the challenges of synthesis , which is , if you do all of the time and energy around the co2 problem , all of the other goals , in order to make all of the other dimension , all of the other goals of the sciences , the recreation of the brightness , the recreation of malaria , and so that it is a disincentive to help money in order to help money in order to help money , as it can help .
bg : well , the real mile for us -- let 's say the u.s. should be 10 billion a year , and it 's not so unique .
in fact , they do n't want to suffer from other people .
you go to big <unk> , and here 's a lot of people , if you have something that is n't worth of , and try to cure that .
it 's because it 's very short of the <unk> , and i 'm going to be able to do the knowledge . i think we should be more things that the potential have to be very cheap .
if the <unk> you can get a very high school , you can only keep the rich .
i mean , every one of us here is going to be five times as much for our energy without change .
for the lower two billion , it 's a disaster .
and even <unk> .
his new <unk> is now , `` why does n't do this research anymore ? ''
he will still be because of his former histories , with the <unk> , but he realized that it 's a very small group , and therefore he 's going to be <unk> .
and this is a graduate student that i think for a second .
so the research , it 's just crazy how much it is .
bill , i think i 'm talking about almost today , when i say , i hope it 's good . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , here , ted , peter <unk> a <unk> called `` <unk> . ''
now , the idea is pretty simple , <unk> , the highest <unk> structures with 20 <unk> , about <unk> <unk> and a cat .
the bronx must be left .
and , again , it 's really hard because it 's trying to do it very quickly .
and so i thought that this is a interesting idea , and i built it in a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
since then , in fact , i 've spent about 70 <unk> across the world , with students , <unk> and architects , even with <unk> of the <unk> , and there 's something about the <unk> of collaboration , and i wanted to share some of them .
normally , people are learning to learn themselves from the task .
they 're talking about what you 're going to look like you 're going to do .
then they get a little bit of time and a organization , and they are <unk> and <unk> .
they invest in a lot of their time in the 2020s .
and finally , just before you have a lot of time , a lot of someone , the wright , and they make it down on the top , and you get a step back and `` <unk> '' -- do you have your work .
but what 's going on , is that the `` 3s '' with a <unk> , because the weight of the chicken is going to do it .
there 's a lot of people who have a lot more than `` <unk> , '' and there are many <unk> .
they lie , they are willing , they are confused , and they 're really <unk> .
and of course , there are also a lot of a lot more than `` <unk> , '' and in the best , the <unk> of the <unk> .
and this is pretty amazing .
as a friend , you do n't just have the highest divide , but the most important structures of all .
what you want to ask , how does it mean ? why ? what is it ?
and peter said , `` no of the kids need to be in the government of the <unk> . ''
they do n't invest for <unk> .
but there 's another reason .
and that was <unk> that were forced to be able to find a real plan , ok .
and then it goes .
what happens when you saw the wheels on the top , you have no time and what ?
it 's a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
and what doesn’t work is , you know , is that you can start with the soviets and create prototypes , a lot of improvement , always with the doors to the bottom , so that they 're trying to create the opportunity to do .
now , these are the kinds of collaboration as a result of collaboration .
and with every attempt , the kids are getting sick of what works and what do n't .
so , of course , the results , work with work , far -- but look at how different vehicles are .
the average rate of most of them is about <unk> , <unk> , who are more likely to do better , but not much , <unk> devices .
who is the last one ?
war and engineers , for happiness .
<unk> is the highest thing i 've seen .
and why is it ? because they 're trying to understand and measure mathematical patterns are the key to build additional structures .
we 're going to take a lot about three . but here 's interesting .
if you 're going to have a postcard , you 're going to be <unk> .
it 's amazing . they look like this team is going to win . ''
you can predict the question . why is this ?
because you have special skills of the <unk> .
they prioritize the process , they understand it .
and this team that makes it stable and on the work of solving the causes of well-being .
<unk> skills and <unk> of them .
if you have 10 , the typical person , you have about six , the mechanical structures .
i tried to be something .
i thought , let 's take the <unk> .
so i sent a <unk> member of a <unk> for a teacher .
what do you think about these gals ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . she had a team structure .
if somebody had a high place on the ground , it would have been the price of home .
so it 's not interesting that there 's a big impact ?
we <unk> this exercise with the same students .
so what do you think ?
now they understood the benefit of `` <unk> . ''
so that 's been in the same , as a team of a piece of paper .
they get the highest on the whole time .
so there are a lot of lessons for us , from nature and success .
now , you may ask , why would you just be able to create business policy ?
and the reason is , i use digital tools , understanding ways to help , cars , video games and `` <unk> . ''
and what the <unk> is doing is , they 're trying to show you this visualization .
in fact , every project has his own pearl earring .
the challenge is a common language , a common language .
and this is the value of this experience , which is so rare .
and these are you who are interested in , <unk> .
it 's a blog , where you see how to read it .
there 's a <unk> there .
you find some crazy examples of all the world , and people people are <unk> and <unk> .
there are also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i believe that the one is actually a <unk> conflict .
it tells us that all of our senses is to make us think about our feelings , how our feelings and our lives , in the challenge that we have .
and sometimes a small prototype of all of our experience everything is to tell us about a `` <unk> , '' for a <unk> .
and that can make a great difference .
thank you very much .
let 's take this machine .
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and that 's a time .
and everyone in this room has to go .
and you can go to the past , you can go into the future ; you can not be in here .
and i think i 'd like to do , because i spent some friends in the last few days , and they would have all come to the past .
i do n't know . she wanted to go back to the car before the cars were twitter or twitter , or america .
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced you 're going to be a <unk> , which is decentralization .
and that 's what i understand .
i 'm not part of this group , i have to say .
i do n't want to stand in the past , and i 'm not because i 'm a conjurer .
it 's because it does n't go back to the planet .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the most fun time that it had ever been on the planet , not knowing what they want to do : health , wealth , mobility .
there were never a time ago .
my bitches died every day .
my grandparents took these number two .
my parents are about 80 in the classrooms .
so it was better by the last few years .
but it 's not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child , which is now in new delhi is just as long as the richest man in the world .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox was 100,000 dollars a million people on this planet .
they have the laws of the earth on a way , which is not a war .
they are gone . they are gone .
we have <unk> them . they did .
in the world world disease , the millions of us have just been one of the generation , we have n't yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
anybody else knows what ?
<unk> , modern medicine , our ability to stay billions of people who are successes of science .
and from my view , the scientific method is trying to try to explore things together , whether it works , if it works , it does n't change it .
so that 's the good news .
unfortunately , this is the whole good news , because there 's a few other issues , and they are still mentioned .
and one of them is , despite all of our achievements , as a billion people on the world , every day , with every day .
this number goes down , and it goes very fast , and that 's false .
and not just us , we have our imagination to create this world .
trees , <unk> land , congo , oil , oil , oil , oil -- they disappear , and if we do n't get out of the chaos , we would continue to get out of the chaos .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it 's clear that we can eat food , the billions of millions of people , without the land that you live .
i think we can use this world with energy , but it 's not the same time .
i think that 's not .
but that 's what i 'm talking about at night -- one of the things that really scare me at night -- we have scientific progress , and it 's never yet .
and we 've never been able to push it down , as we can do it .
and we are in the threshold , there 's amazing events in many places , and yet we really know that we have hundreds of thousands of years that we have to go back to a lot of time in the world that we have to go over here , we 've been able to figure out a time where we have progress on this kind of things that are more vulnerable than now .
the people can be understood in their opinion , and so they can not keep it .
not just the truth .
and listen , everyone has a right on his opinion , even a true on his opinion .
but you know , what are you right ?
you do n't have to look at your own facts . you ca n't .
and i started to have a while to understand this .
for about a decade ago , i got a paper article about `` the new york , '' a little article .
and i was amazed by creating resistance , and it 's too much on the bottom of the human rights in the history of humanity .
i did n't know what to do , so i just did what i 'm going to do , i wrote a paper ,
and shortly after i wrote a paper about <unk> changed .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were mad .
so , i was looking for this article , and i did n't understand why the people thought that was called `` <unk> , '' which he said that molecules are in a particular way , instead of finding out of nature .
but you know , i do what i do .
i mean , i 'm a journalist .
we 're going to get a lot of us , we go to eat .
but these articles made me , and i could n't figure out why .
and that 's because these <unk> , who did n't untie me at all .
these were <unk> people , thousands of people , <unk> people .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
and that continued to me .
but then i thought , you know what we were .
we are in a point where we do n't have the same relationship with progress .
we talk about it .
we 're going to talk about it , with a few centuries , `` progress . ''
okay , there 's some reasons , and i think we know what i do .
we have the trust in institutions , and even in the science of china , and there is no reason why this should not be .
you can just take a couple of name , and people can understand .
<unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , muslims , the year 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
so , there are questions and problems with people who have thought that they were always right .
ask yourself , you ask you to find the evidence , ask you .
do n't do it .
but now , in fact , if you have to look at the evidence , you have to look at this image , and we are not good .
and i can tell you that we have in a epidemic of fear , as i never saw them and never .
about about 12 years ago , a story story has been a story story , a fantastic story , which is the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
very scary .
there were pigeons studies to see if it was .
within decades studies , it 's a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came out of the united states from england , from sweden , from canada , from canada , from canada , and they were all alike .
it does n't make a difference . it does n't make a difference , because we think what we believe in terms of what we believe what we do .
we do n't believe in a couple of documents of a <unk> , which is our data , and i understand that .
but you know what ?
the result of this was mad .
babri for the fact : the united states is one of the two countries on the world , the overproduction for herman .
this is a breakthrough , and we should be ashamed .
it 's gorgeous .
what 's happening we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
so , anybody else ?
is a single one in the audience ever want to die ?
it 's not very often .
in fact , in this country , not in the country , not in the country in the last year .
this is a lot of deaths through <unk> , 20 cents .
but because this does n't happen to this , we can hear it , and people like <unk> , and email from fear and <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> king lives .
and you can do it because they do n't get and adapt .
they do n't understand that things are like the same thing , but it 's never been the same .
and that 's something that we have to learn and very quickly .
this guy was a hero , <unk> .
he invites us from one of the worst nightmares of humanity .
no fear , no eyelashes , <unk> , wet .
the guy in the middle valley .
he 's paul paul <unk> .
he has just been a few other people that you 've got a few other people .
he can save the lives of <unk> , more kids from the developing world .
all right , right ?
well , that 's good to say , paul <unk> and talk about <unk> , and says how dangerous you are , and that people are trying to stop .
and that 's what he looks like .
so it 's a graduate student .
now , paul paul in a public sphere , he ca n't buy any heartbeat .
he 's going to go to home , because people say to tell you , where home kids go to school .
and why ?
i do n't need to say that , but communication are cultural .
take a look at the disease , ordinary diseases , and that 's right now .
we have now <unk> in this country .
and this is worse , and pretty soon , children will die for itself , because that 's just a question of numbers .
and they 're not just going to be <unk> .
what is it ?
and i 'm going to highlight a few weeks ago , and i said , `` i think it 's a little bit <unk> .
no one ever did .
she would not lend her child .
<unk> .
why ? because we have a <unk> , and you know what ?
we had no written in this country at night .
today , i do n't know , if i 'm talking about somewhere in lagos in a plane , and in the age of the north , he 's about <unk> .
and in a few hours , he goes and <unk> a car , and it goes to long beach , and he 's going to take one of the <unk> <unk> today .
and he does n't know that he 's outlined with a <unk> disease , and we do n't know because it works the world .
this is the planet that we live . do n't do it .
we love to stop ourselves in afghanistan . we love that .
now , have you taken all of the dolphins ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , allowing them to do .
i know that they did that , because the most of the americans do it every day .
they look at the stuff , and they look at the design , and it does n't make a difference .
the data shows all the time .
they get their <unk> . they do n't always forget .
that 's okay , you want to talk about 75 billion dollars for dark matter .
i read them .
it 's dark . dark .
why do we do ? why do we do it ?
well , i think we 're -- we hate the <unk> .
we hate a lot of government . we have no trust to the system .
and that 's not what our economy is .
it 's cruel to people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and <unk> ourselves to do it .
so , we 're looking up , and where are we headed ?
we are in the poor of the <unk> .
this is great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , that 's really a serious story , because the stuff is needles , and we spend billions of dollars .
and i have all sorts of little shots .
none of them -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , so i do n't know what this is , but we spend billions of dollars for it .
and you know what ? if i say that , i 'm talking to people , and say , `` what do you do ? let 's do people like what you want .
they feel good . ''
and you know what ? you 've got wrong .
because i 'm not interested in whether it 's the <unk> , who says , `` hmm , i 'm going to use the message of the experts , but i 'm not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do the rest of the experts .
if you go to the bottom , where you do n't mind magic and imagination , or whatever you can not do science , and they will not be .
they go to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he led us to <unk> us , because he insisted that the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are more powerful than <unk> drugs that we know that they can learn the same for aids .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths in a country , as opposed to each other of these diseases .
do n't tell me that things are not consequences .
they have always . they have always .
now , the <unk> epidemic , where we 're now in this is the <unk> fight between the <unk> and <unk> .
this is a self-fulfilling debate . it has to stop .
it 's a debate about words , as happy .
that 's political , not science .
all of what we eat , every <unk> , every <unk> , every year of life .
you know , there was no <unk> in the garden .
there were no escape hatch .
we did n't have a street . we 've done everything .
we 've done it in the last 100,000 years .
and some of them , it does n't work .
we 've done what 's not happening .
now we can do it . and of course , there is risks . but , of course , it 's risks . but we can make something like any one in a <unk> , and the stuff can help millions of millions of people .
do n't want to do it ?
i have to say i do n't understand .
we were <unk> <unk> food food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i 'm always wrong is to do a lot of chemicals , pesticides , pesticides , <unk> , we do n't want to be a huge amount of something that is wrong .
we do n't want our companies live .
we do n't want people to have babies .
and you know what my answer is all of that ?
yes , you have . we can do it .
it 's true , we have a huge <unk> , but that 's not science .
that has nothing to do with science .
it 's right , morality , <unk> .
you know that science is not a company .
it 's not a country .
it 's not a idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it does n't work , and sometimes it does n't work , but the idea that we should n't do science with their work , because we have a really dead , and it 's millions of people from the ground .
you know , in the next 50 years , we will have 70 percent more food than the moment .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
wow . fold .
they need that , and we do n't .
and why ? hoover changed food .
we do n't want to encourage people to use this <unk> information , like for example .
<unk> is something which killed half a billion people .
it 's something like that .
it 's just a ton of calories . it is resilient .
it does n't have roots , it does n't have a protein , and scientists do all of it in it .
and then people could be the food and they would n't be blind .
they would n't go extinct , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it would not be <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and all of what i can say , why are we going to say that ?
i mean , we ask myself , why do we care ?
because we do n't have any genes ?
it 's not about genes , it 's not about chemicals .
it 's not about our intellectual passion for machines , our legitimacy on higher food , healthy food .
it 's not about <unk> <unk> , it 's about people to live alive , and it 's highest time to understand what it means .
because you know what ?
so if we do n't do that if we 're going to do as far as we 're going to do , we think about something like me , i think , not to be <unk> .
there 's no other description for what 's going on .
it 's selfish , it 's ugly , it 's ugly , and we have to do that .
so , that 's incredibly curious conversation , you want to say , `` would you still get in this crazy movie and in the future ? ''
in any case . that 's what i want to do .
right now , you have in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can look at it for all of what we want .
we can put them where we want to take them up , and we 'll get them going to go to where we want .
we have to be able to use these conversations , and we need to think , but when we 're going to go into the way , we 're going to be in the future , we 'll be able to do that .
i know that we can do , and because it is something that the world is now .
thank you .
thank you .
now , for some time , i 'm interested in the <unk> . it might seem like a magician for me , it feels like me , or a deception that 's going to be a little bit about if someone only knows .
in other words , <unk> , you have a <unk> show , the <unk> , and that 's just because of the person , what 's going on your mind , is a <unk> or a kind of -- in the first place , there 's a <unk> or a kind of ...
a deception is going to be true , because someone knows .
and so we can understand each other , i think you can now show you a very , very simple inversion .
and i 'm going to show you how he works . this is a trick that 's at the end of his 20s .
i learned him from the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> in the 1970s .
i 'm going to make it for you and you can tell you .
and then i 'm going to tell you why .
so , look what happens .
the knife that you can read ; my hand can read them .
i 'm going to keep the plank in my hand .
i <unk> my <unk> .
and so you can do n't realize that in my inbox , if you 're looking for me , i 'm going to do my wrist right now .
and so , you can see that there 's no way you can do anything else .
and the goal is very simple .
i 'm going to get my hand , and hopefully , if all you are doing is my knife through my backpack .
it 's actually so much on the place that i can buy .
nothing is inside my sleeve or come out , no matter , and you can see everything .
<unk> !
well , this is a trick that i often often love to help your kids out of attention , because you can make a lot about deception , because it 's a very simple trick .
so , you know , a lot of you here in this room .
so it works .
i think the knife in my hand .
i 'm saying that i gave my wrist on , which is nothing in my sleeve .
and the reason i 'm hearing behind you -- as the higgs boson , is that the actual secret of illusion .
in the moment , where i put my hand from you , you see it from the back , you know , where you were in a position where it was like .
amazing story ?
on the back , somebody who has n't been a kid .
so , he 's coming . exactly .
and when i <unk> me , that 's what i 'm going to do with them .
and now , you can talk about why this is a success story , why do n't know that there is just three examples , because the mind and the way it 's information , because they ca n't travel , one , two , three , but it 's not a group .
but that 's not what i do n't do at all .
of course , it 's going to be <unk> , but by the <unk> of my body , with my heart , with my portrait , now .
and when i take my hand up , the same thing i get <unk> me through this movement that comes back to me .
i 'll take this hand . and this is the knife .
this is the trick you can read your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what did that do with the <unk> ?
a year or so , i read a study that i really did .
i 'm not a doctor or <unk> , and so that 's what i was an amazing thing .
this is what happens when you put a <unk> on a white ball in the form of a <unk> , it 's just a slow , white face , which obeys a particular dimension .
but if you go to the shape , you get the <unk> , for example , in a smaller ball , and that blue is a <unk> , and it 's actually <unk> transparent .
and you know , even though they do n't have any programmers -- it 's just <unk> .
but a white pill is not so much like a blue wall .
what ? that 's what i did .
but it turns out that it 's not all .
now , if you take you , you are more likely to be treated as thick .
a traditional arm that 's at a end of yellow , and at the same red , it 's better than a white arm .
also the <unk> is a role .
a pill twice as much pills -- i 'm not able to remember the right statistics . sorry .
but the challenge is ...
now , the <unk> becomes a role .
and the shape is a role .
and if you want to take the ultimate <unk> , you have to get a needle .
right ? a syringe with a revision , a few <unk> of a <unk> substance that you have a patient .
this is a very strong image in the head . that 's very much more than a white wall .
this graph is really -- i 'm going to show you a different time when we have a <unk> .
so the fact that the white pill does n't look like the blue pill , not so much like a lump that does n't like it .
and none of it has to do some research , it 's just our belief that we 're going to create a long-term impact .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magician .
i 'm doing something that 's obvious , and i 'm going to look at it .
we know from this study that you have to get to the bottom , if it 's supposed to go .
this is a 18 inches long , and it 's very , very <unk> , and i 'm going to get you a little bit like this .
this is really my meat . it 's not an effective amount of meat .
this is my skin . that 's not a <unk> .
so i 'm going to take this needle in my skin , and you get it down to the other side again .
now , if you think about it -- if you get a lot of friends in college , i 've had the few people last week in the 1970s , and some of the people i did n't know .
so what i 'm trying to do when you 're going to be happy , look at the next 30 seconds , or you know what i 'm going to do in the edge .
you can see it , but you can also see if you want it .
so , it 's like this , where my flesh starts to the bottom part of my <unk> , i 'm just going to make a little <unk> .
i 'm sorry . do you hear that crazy ?
and now just a little bit of my skin and on the other side .
now we 've been in the same situation we 've been used for .
it 's about .
but now you can not understand my finger ?
so , i 'll show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people people think if you see it .
they say , `` okay , that 's probably not so awful , and <unk> the skin , just for us a few minutes . ''
now , i 'll show you .
how does this look like ? ok .
yeah , i know .
and people say , `` okay . i do n't see it right . ''
the people in the <unk> are coming .
so let me show you .
this is really my skin . that 's not a <unk> .
this is my meat , and i can do it .
sorry for me . if you want you to look at you , look at you .
the people in the morning , and the way that you looked at the video games would say , `` well , this is pretty beautiful , but if it 's real , you know , this is a hole , and then it would be true , it 's a hole . ''
okay , let me play a little blood vessel .
yes , here it is .
now , i would like the needle to the needle .
i would take my arm , and you show you that there were no wires .
but i think in this painting , with the intention of a great deal , i 'm going to get the needle there and so forth .
we 'll be a few days ago .
i hope you 've done it . thank you very much .
everybody 's talking about happiness .
i 've met some people who had heard of the books of books in the last five years , and they gave them about 40 years , and there was a lot more .
there 's a huge wave of knowledge for centuries .
there are very much <unk> .
everybody would want to make people better .
but despite all of these accidents of work , there are several generations that they do n't seem to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly by these cognitive clusters .
this is for <unk> , who are talking about their own happiness , and it 's for scientists to think about happiness .
the first one of these <unk> is a <unk> technology .
it turns out that the word happiness is happiness is more complicated because we do it in many different things .
i think there is a sense that we can think about , but in the big , and that 's something that we need to be , and we are going to be able to be able to think about how much well-being .
the second one is a <unk> of experience and memory : in fact , they are between happy with his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they 're both embedded in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and this is the radical fact that we can not think about the possibility of well-being , without making meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive proposition .
there is just no way to get it right .
now , i 'd like to talk to a example of someone who was wearing a fulbright that i had a story , and he was saying , he said , `` he said he would say a birthday . ''
and then he <unk> it , really quite sure , the whole experience .
but that did n't .
what it was all the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of music music .
they did n't , because he was talking about a memory , the memory was the same , and the memory is all he had to win .
what we have to do is that we think about us , and about other people , if you can think about two things of itself .
there 's a <unk> self , who 's in the present and the present , the two , the past , but most importantly .
it 's the <unk> yourself , who 's a doctor , you know , when the doctor says , `` do n't i get you here ? ''
and then there 's a lot of self , and the <unk> self is , and the history of our life , and it 's the ones that the doctor is going to explode through the question .
or `` how did your trip ? '' or so on .
these are two very different planes , the <unk> themselves , and the two self , and the two is forced to the <unk> of happiness .
well , the <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and this starts really familiar with a fundamental reaction to our memory -- it starts immediately .
we do n't just tell stories if we tell ourselves about this .
so our memory tells us stories , which means what we should be talking about our knowledge is a story .
and let 's take a look at an example .
there 's another old study .
these are real patients who are used for a while .
and i 'm not going to play in detail . it 's not particularly painful , but it was painful because this trial was in the 1990s .
they were asked to spend all eight seconds .
and here are two patients . these are their ] .
and they said , `` who are both less ? ''
and this is a very simple question .
google has been more likely to be done , and it 's about 10 times , and every moment of pain , the patient had a patient patient .
but now , there 's another question : `` how many times these guys that they were ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient had a lot of <unk> <unk> of the brain as a patient .
the stories of the <unk> were different , and because of a very important part of the story , how it was .
and no one of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this .
but one of them is quite worse than the others .
and the one that was worse than the pain was at the end of his nose . it 's a bad story .
how do we know ?
because we were asking these people who were asked , and how did it be the whole thing ?
and it was much worse than a piece of paper in the <unk> .
well , this is a constant conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> itself .
in fact , the <unk> self has been a lot of time .
now , what you could do a patient 's done , and we 've actually done clinical experiments , and it was done , and it worked , you could actually be able to make the <unk> of the top of the group that you could do with the <unk> in a way that you could do it .
this is the case that the patient is , but only a little bit less than before .
and if you 've done that , you know , for example , you spend a few minutes , you realize that it 's a lot of work , and you 've got to realize that it 's a lot of work , and you 've got to make sure that it 's worth of your life better , because now , you have a better life on your experience .
what is a story about this ?
and this is for the stories that memory comes to us , and it 's also for the stories we are .
so , a story is <unk> , of course , interesting story ,
you 're very , very important , and this is the <unk> of the end .
well , the <unk> self has changed their lives .
it 's like , of course , the <unk> of a half , a way .
and you ask , what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're lost forever .
i mean , most of the life of our life -- and i 've been talking about -- you know , the psychological languages is about 25 million of them . in a month , there 's about 25,000 million of them do n't get you .
most of them will be completely influenced by itself .
and yet , you know , the kind of thing that you should be aware of what is happening as the other side of our <unk> .
it 's the <unk> resource that we are in the world .
and as we decide if it would be really important , but that 's not the story that connects us to protect ourselves .
so we 've got the <unk> self and the <unk> themselves , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is time .
in fact , in fact , if you have a meeting , and when the second week week , and the second week week is so good as the first , then the <unk> ring twice as well as the <unk> .
that does n't work for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself , there 's no <unk> grant from the <unk> , because there 's no new memory .
you have n't changed the story .
and in this way , this is actually the critical aspect , which is a <unk> self , and it 's a little bit of influence on this story .
now , the <unk> itself takes more than ted and learning stories .
it 's actually the future , because if you have a patient , we 've got two nights out of two different cultures , and you can decide what he wants to be able to be , and that 's the surgeon who had no bad .
the <unk> itself has no voice in this .
in fact , we do n't choose between memory , and we choose between ourselves .
and even when we think about the future , we think we 're not going to do with the future .
we think about our future as an adult life .
and in fact , you can see that , as you can think about it , as a <unk> of the <unk> , and you can think about the <unk> itself as a one , the way , the same self , even though , the ability to learn the <unk> self .
i have the impression that when we 're going to get rid of this , it 's very often the case , we 're going to get hurt in the train itself .
and that 's a little bit too , i think .
i mean , how do you know about our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that the problem itself has to be abolished .
and when i think about it , i think about a grant that we had a few years ago , where it was a lot of years ago , where i had ever done , and i think there were relatively <unk> on the relationship .
and i 'm probably talking about my memories , and i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had the dark pictures of the 600 pictures i had another .
now , these are three weeks , and that 's a few hours a couple of weeks .
there seems to be a seat .
now , i want to be a little bit bigger , you know , in the way , i mean , in the way , you know , how do you get to the <unk> of memory , but even if you do it 's a real question . why do we need memory so much weight on the weight that you do ?
so i want you to think about a thought .
so imagine your next meeting , you know that at the end of your shirt , all of these pictures are all the images , and they get a <unk> service that they do n't remember .
now , would you choose the same stick ?
and if you think about another person , there 's a conflict between your two types of self , and you have to think about how to do , and if you think about the answer , you know , if you have to think about it , you know , if you think about it , you know , if you think , you know , if you think in the sense of information thinking , you have a different answer .
what we 're talking about is that we have a problem that tells us with a choice between the two types of itself .
well , these two types of self are two words of happiness .
in fact , we have two concepts of happiness that we can use , a less self .
so you can ask : `` how can you be the <unk> ?
and then you would ask , how happy are the words in life ?
and they are all -- boring for example is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be used ?
and , by the way , we are just a good idea of happiness , for the time .
if you ask for the happiness of the kindness of yourself , it 's a very different thing .
that 's not about how happy a person live .
it 's like , or whether the person is when the person is about life .
very different architecture .
everyone who has n't like to do that , because of the sake of happiness , and i 'm part of a lot of researchers about well-being that can help me with this kind of happiness .
so the distinction between the happiness itself itself , and the kindness of the <unk> of it has been in the last few years , and now you learn to create the two notes .
the <unk> organization had a global survey , and more than a half million people have been wondering about what they think about their lives , and they had other people in the direction .
so in the last few years , we began to learn about the two points of self .
and the sum lesson we have , i think , is that they are really different .
you can know how to anyone with his life , and they do n't really tell a little bit about how happy he lives his life and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the <unk> , the link is about <unk> .
what it means is that if you 'd like you , and you would tell you , oh , dad would be a <unk> , how much you would know about your size ?
well , you would know something about his size , but there 's a lot of uncertainty .
you have a lot of uncertainty .
now , if i tell you that someone is eight as a half of 10 , a half of humor , you know , how hard he is with your <unk> self .
so the injection is so much .
we know something about the notion of music .
we know that money is very important is goals .
we know that happiness is to be satisfied with people who we love to spend time with people that we like time .
there are other luck , but that 's kind of fun .
so , if you want to be the lucky of the two types of self , you want to do a lot of different things .
the implication of what i told us is that we should n't be able to be able to imagine as a win-win tool .
it 's a completely different idea .
now , very short , another reason we do n't think about happiness , we can not think about happiness , when we think about life .
so if you ask the simple question , how hard people are in california , they will not be the right answer .
now , if you think about this question , you think that people are going to be able to live in california , if you say , in our lives .
and what 's happening when you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that 's why we 're in the climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the <unk> self , and it 's not even very important for the <unk> self , as happy people are .
now , because the <unk> itself is responsible for them , they can end -- a few people could come to school .
and it 's kind of interesting to what 's going on with people who are talking to california , to become happier .
well , your <unk> self will be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to be , and you 'll think that you can be happier , because when you 're going to think about how much the weather is in the north , and you 'll feel that they have the right decision .
it 's very hard to think about well-being , and i hope you have a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you very much .
now , when we had a couple of weeks ago , i 've seen something about this a pretty interesting results that came out of that geyser survey .
is it something that you can do , because you have a few minutes ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most important thing we 've found in the <unk> survey is a number that we have absolutely not .
and what we found was interested in happiness .
if we were starting to think about emotions , it 's expanding .
and it turns out from a income of 300 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large decline of americans , about 300 dollars a year .
<unk> .
<unk> : 37 .
eighty dollars in the year , people are unhappy , and they will be cheaper , they just become .
so this is a very <unk> line .
i mean , i 've just seen three-dimensional lines .
what 's happening is that money does n't have a <unk> player , but that lack of money , and we can do this extraordinarily very , very clear .
in the spirit of other people , the squad itself , you get another story .
the more money you have , the more you are .
that 's not true for emotions .
but danny , in the entire u.s. economy , there 's life , freedom to happiness .
now , if people were going to be serious seriously , i mean , it seems to look at the head , all of what we believe in terms of interest and so forth .
is there a chance that politicians thought that the country is going to make a sense of how improbable ?
dk : you know , i believe that there is the role of the difference in politics .
it 's going to be changed in the united states , no question , but in the united states , it 's going on and in other countries .
so people are saying that they should be happy to believe if you think about politics .
it 's going to be a long time , and the people are going to be able to identify or whether they want to explore , or whether they want to find out the discussion .
how do you feel hard to think about how you think , or whether you think about yourself , or whether you can think about it .
this is what defines us , i think , in the past years .
in the united states , you 're looking for the <unk> of the population .
this is , i think , in the next one or two decades .
well , it seems to me , i 'm going to be the subject , or should still be the most important political debate for the next few years .
thank you for the invention of economics .
thank you , scott <unk> .
i 'm morgan cola . i play video games .
i 'm going to talk about 10 years today , and my aim for the next decade is to make it so much to understand the world in reality .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including them , more time with play games and play games .
in fact , we spend three billion hours per week .
some of you may think , `` this is a whole lot of time for games . ''
maybe a lot of time , if you think about how many problems we need to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research on the center of the future is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours per week is not enough enough to solve the same problems of the world .
in fact , i 'm convinced that when we want to survive the next century , we 've got to have that capability .
i 've been using sure that the less time of 21 billion hours per week .
this seems to be a little bit easier , so i 'm going to try to do it , if we can solve problems , when we solve problems like war , poverty , global warming and obesity , i think we need to help , games to work together at least 21 billion hours per week .
no , i do n't know .
why ? because this picture is pretty much , i believe that games are so important for all the human species in the future .
this is a regular set of <unk> <unk> .
he was trying to play the emotions in the games , so he was able to get the camera a camera .
this is one of the classic language of play .
if you 're not a player , you just want to show some of the earrings in this picture .
they just look at this sense of urgency , a lot of fear , but also , people are really focused on the verge of a real difficult problem .
now , if you go to see , you see a lot of <unk> here , the way you see , and the mouth are a sign of shame .
this is a player who 's on the edge of a call .
oh , you know , okay . so , ok . so , you have a player here .
a pakistani victory is a result that 's so much positive that they did n't know that it was possible .
it was pretty close to the imagination .
and if you have it , you know , you 're actually able to be able to be able to do it .
this player is short of a <unk> victory .
and this is what we have to look at 65 million simultaneous <unk> on all the world , if we look at the <unk> of the next century , the face of the <unk> of a <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we see in the face of the face in the real life when we look at other problems .
i read it as `` i live ? '' is n't my face , you see ? yes .
that 's me , as i 'm going to live , i 'm sorry .
this is a <unk> in my hometown home in my hometown of california , california , where i was working on play in the <unk> ,
this is a problem that has a lot of gamers .
we think we are not so good in games .
and i do n't just have less successful , although that 's what it is .
we 're going to work in <unk> . i mean myself in the context with how to make something wrong , especially to collaboration .
so when we are in a <unk> , i think many of us are able to solve the best version , and so they 're going to solve the problem with the same way that we 're trying to solve .
and in reality , if we eat , if we eat , we feel often differently .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel <unk> ; we feel <unk> , even depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
we do n't feel like that , if you play games , you 're gon na play it .
and that 's what i wanted to do with a paraglider .
why is it possible in games , and you can not just do anything ?
how can we create these emotions in the reality ?
so i started games to find the world of warcraft , which is the ideal of the <unk> environment .
and i have a lot of things that i 'm proposing can make sure .
so , first , if you 're sitting in one of these <unk> , especially in the world of warcraft , there 's a lot of different characters that are willing to show you a <unk> mission .
but not only a mission , but a mission , the perfect to the perfect level in the game , right ?
so you can do that .
you have to have a task you can not solve .
but always on the edge of their skills , so they 're going to say , but there 's no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you do n't get around , and you 're <unk> . there are always about a big deal .
and there are fewer employees .
where they go to hundreds of thousands of people who are working with them to build their glass mission .
we have n't been able to do that in the real life , but that is that feeling that we have n't have to get divorced .
and also , there 's this epic story , and we 've got this ted story about why we are here and what we do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
you 've heard of `` lean '' '' and `` scared '' or `` <unk> intelligence . ''
there are no serious feedback in the real life .
now , if i 'm going to do this stage , i do n't know , t , and i do n't want to say , forget , a good idea .
i 'm not living in the real life .
so , the problem of the <unk> of the world 's <unk> is that it 's so consistent with the edge of a <unk> <unk> that we 're trying to take our whole time in these <unk> .
they 're just better than the reality .
so , despite today , all the world of <unk> pollutants have spent millions of years ago , the virtual problems of dystonia .
it 's not necessarily a bad bad .
it sounds bad .
but to see it in the context , <unk> million million years ago , our first <unk> <unk> .
so the first <unk> model .
ok , so , when we talk about how much i think about how much time , we 're going to play the same thing when you get the time of the human development , you know , that 's cheap .
but also , as well , because it turns out that we are using these whole time , we can use what we 're going to be as humans .
we are endangering ourselves to do things .
this is the truth . that 's what i believe .
now , if you look at this interesting statistic , the recently of a sudden , the mayor of a year 's mayor , the average young man , from today , in the average young man , 10,000 hours of <unk> , for the 21st century .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number .
first time for kids in the united states , you know , the <unk> <unk> that you spend in school .
so , we have a whole bunch of carbon technology on the young people who are learning to be a good player , like everything else in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of raleigh , `` <unk> . ''
so you see his theory of success , the theory of success of 10,000 hours .
it 's based on the great research of the <unk> , which is that when we spend 10,000 hours , we spend a few more to spend over the 21st .
we 're going to do it in the world , and we 're going to do the same people in the world .
so what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , `` what exactly is the player ? ''
because if we could figure out , we would never have to think about the human human lifespan .
so many people we have in the world that we 've been working in the world , at least in the world , at least in the world , we 've been working for a few hours a day .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people who are wonderful .
and in the next decade , we have a hundred billion players that are really good to us .
if you ca n't hear it .
and the <unk> communities that make energy energy , and on their work , rather than in the world , particularly in india , china , sub-saharan africa .
you expect a hundred billion player in the next decade .
that 's why we have 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what it is to make us play games .
here are the four things that i found .
ok , imagine that the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to be wrong to make a cause , and so with us , believe that we have a <unk> hope .
scientists think the way it 's possible to be a <unk> victory , and that it 's all about it , and that 's just too .
diets do n't sit around .
scientists are <unk> in hells .
there 's a lot more interesting species that show us that we 've been able to tell people that we have to show with them , even when they have a stutter .
and the reason for this is that it requires a lot of trust to play a game .
we trust that someone is time to us , the rules that we have the same goal and we can get to the salt .
so this is how the outlets are used by <unk> , trust .
so , as a result of work , we are more social relationships .
<unk> security . fantastic .
you know , there 's a reason why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours per week , for example .
and the reason is that when we play , we 're actually going to work hard , we 're going to work hard , when we hate milo or anything .
we know that when human beings do work when we 're lucky , wonderful work .
and investors are always willing to work when they get the right thing .
and finally , memetics .
scientists love to be part of the <unk> of the <unk> .
here 's a <unk> that 's looking at the right light , showing you all the wikipedia , the largest <unk> of the world .
the second largest <unk> of the world , again , almost almost <unk> of the world of warcraft .
five million people die of every month .
they have more information about world of warcraft in the internet as a different way in any other species of the world .
they create a epic story .
you create a dome of a lot about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four people who are used to be a single outcome . scientists are <unk> , laws .
these are people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is that they believe they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real world .
this is the problem i 'm trying to solve .
david <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is great . he practices know why people spend so much time , energy and money .
and he says , `` we 're going to do n't have less than a <unk> in virtual worlds . ''
and that 's from an economist . and it 's logical .
and he says ...
not like me -- i 'm games , i 'm a little bit more .
so he says , well , you can feel , because players can be able to be able to be able to live in the same life .
you can be able to play social bonds with other than the real life . you get more complicated and happier in the same life .
so , he says it 's totally <unk> , the only more people in the virtual world as well .
i love to do that .
but it 's not a <unk> .
we need to start to make the real world in a game .
my self comes from one event , which is only two years ago .
there are these <unk> wear , <unk> . you know ?
so there was a fantastic <unk> ,
and these were the first of people who were created .
and if you 're talking to the ancient greek <unk> , you may know that story . the story about how it 's like .
<unk> <unk> , games , sort of <unk> , where they were invented as a famine .
and then , when there was an amazing famine , the king of the <unk> , a <unk> idea .
people were dying . people hate .
it was an extraordinary situation . we needed a huge solution .
so they decided to be <unk> , the <unk> and put a national strategy . the next day you would play .
and they would be very interested in the <unk> , and games are so fascinating , and then with <unk> , <unk> radiation , that they were forgotten to eat .
and then the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat .
and as <unk> <unk> , they were so 18 years old , so they went back to a day , and the next one .
the same thing , i think , let 's play now .
we 're going to play games for the real world .
we 're going to play games to make sure that it 's in the real world , all of the real life is not compatible with it , and we 're trying to play what we need .
but it does n't have to be the end .
this is the beauty .
for <unk> years , it was not better , so did the king , the last <unk> .
they put this out in two <unk> .
they played a <unk> , and the head needed to have a <unk> adventure .
they <unk> <unk> , and they went on a new home , and they were so many people back to their lives and start with the rest of a neighborhood where they were able to survive .
this sounds crazy , right ?
but the <unk> <unk> shows that the <unk> , which later , the <unk> , the same dna like the old <unk> .
and so scientists , at the beginning of the buddha , the <unk> of the word was really honest .
and in fact , evidence of evidence , evidence of global citizenship , which is almost 20 years .
so this may be the crazy story .
now , you 've actually had her own people who were going to play 18 years old , and then they had done lots of them , and so many of the things that have found it on the entire civilization .
so , we can .
we 're going to be <unk> .
this was the first <unk> in mind , the world of <unk> . it was 16 years ago .
it took 18 years old , we play for 18 years .
i think we 're willing to play for our own <unk> .
so they sent half of their civilization on a new world , so i 'm going to spend my 21st century .
we should be anxious that half of us have a week a day with your work , until we can solve the problems of the real world .
i know you 're going to say , `` how do we solve problems of the real world in games ? '' and one of the things i 've got to do in my last 20 years in the center for the future .
we have in the banner in our office in palo alto , in order to tell the future .
we do n't want to try to say the future .
what we want to do is the future .
we want to look at the best possible .
we allow ourselves in buddhism .
so i 'm going to show you a couple of three games that i 've developed , to try to make people grapple in their own future .
this is `` world without oil . ''
the game is from 2007 .
it 's a <unk> increase in which you have to have an <unk> .
the <unk> rule is invented , but we have a lot of <unk> , so it 's going to be a lot better , and they have to figure out how to get their real life , if it 's true .
we 've done this game with <unk> players in 2007 . and we 've done it over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it 's a <unk> experience .
nobody wants to change the lives , because it 's good for the environment , or because we should .
but if you were in an <unk> , and we 're going to say , `` stop . ''
this is a fascinating adventure , which you go .
think of how they were struggling , and most of our principles have been able to play the game .
so we 've got to look at the next olympics , a matter of presence , as the <unk> .
we have the game called the <unk> of the center for the future .
so , if you think of yourself , you know , the fact that people have only got 23 years on the planet .
this kogi is called global <unk> <unk> .
it 's called the claim that we can find on the ground , <unk> , we have almost like a <unk> <unk> .
you know , <unk> <unk> , where it 's called `` <unk> , '' and you have the <unk> , the scientists , the <unk> and only together .
but in our game , instead of only five people , we say , every one in the <unk> , and it 's our problem , the future for energy , food , health and the future of social justice .
eighty-two player took the game eight weeks .
they found 500 times more powerful solutions that they can read when they were <unk> .
and the last game we 've got to the three . it 's a game in collaboration with the world trade .
if you go to the game , they get from the world bank , `` social <unk> , '' by 2010 .
we work with universities in africa and to create social companies .
we have a paper program , and we have <unk> , because we have <unk> , to design , sustainability , vision and healthy .
i want to share them all the game with young people , all around the world , especially in <unk> , who are living in their own social society .
i 'm going to finish .
i want to ask you .
what do you think ?
we have all this fantastic player , we have a bunch of things we have to do , but we have the real world .
now , i hope that you 've been told that the player of our cities are able to work in the real life , and the games have a great meaning for change .
we have this whole transformation , <unk> productivity , the ability to use social nets , and the desire to <unk> meaning .
now , i hope that we 're using games games play together for the planet to survive .
and i hope you 'll play with these play games .
so if i 'm going to be able to get into the next decade , i 'm going to have two things , that we can build each other worlds , and that we can learn all sorts of games .
so i say , let 's think about the <unk> games .
thank you .
i 'd like to tell you a little kid with a few months ago , and i was trying to write a book for <unk> .
i was going to write my <unk> , but i was told with the <unk> of the <unk> , and i realized that i was never in my life , which is what the word `` <unk> . ''
i read them .
`` upwake '' , <unk> , `` <unk> , water , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : healthy , more , <unk> .
i 've had this list of a friend <unk> , and i had to find it , and it was so cold , but i was only until `` <unk> , '' and he would have to come back to me , and he was trying to read and find out to me , and he was trying to read and <unk> me to the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
of course , this was a <unk> , child <unk> , and i was just thinking that the copy of it was pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early '80s when i was working with the university , and so i started to see my approach outside of my business design , and in order to other kids and the world around me .
and god 's done , i did n't have to be <unk> .
if i 'm going to take this talk , i would have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get some of the person who would like me , if i had a person who wanted to make their lives in <unk> , positive , i 'm going to have a lot of opportunities and hope that i had .
so i immediately immediately <unk> the hurtigruten of 2009 , and i realized that i think there 's a continuous decline .
here 's the <unk> version of this <unk> .
it 's not a lot better .
in fact , the last two words is `` <unk> '' and `` healthy . ''
but it 's not just words .
it 's about what we think about people think about these words .
it 's about recognizing the inside of the words , and how we use these values .
our language shows our thinking and how we see the world and our people .
a lot of <unk> societies , including the greeks and the secret , really , that you can be a big force , because that 's what you feel like nonstop .
so what do we want to do -- is a <unk> people or a great people ?
in fact , a lot of people as a kid , as a child , it can be <unk> and <unk> things .
would n't it be able to get them back ?
a man who worked up for me was my gateway on the <unk> . everest , in south africa .
he 's called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , as you can think , americans do n't want to name themselves , so he 's been called dr. sam .
and dr. robinson has been very <unk> , and he was working for the work with kids .
i found the time i 've been in this hospital , just <unk> -- until my <unk> .
i 've got to get rid of all the cds , and i 'm going to use these enchanted , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- that you 've got to take my <unk> .
and imagine , i 've ever been as a young child with dr. animation , and so trying to stop this ties , <unk> without success .
and one day , he gave me some of my exercises -- these techniques are just <unk> and courage -- and he said to me , `` wow , <unk> and young girl , you will be one day of one of my <unk> .
and if you 're doing it , i 'll give you a doctor .
now , of course , this is just a simple trick of dr. animation , so i was able to make the exercises i do n't want to do , with the fact that the ceo of <unk> was in the middle of the second car , and he did n't get me to take my daily <unk> with the eyes , and so that 's a new and entrepreneurial experience .
and i think today , how many of these passions was to my mind , and i was able to imagine myself as a part of nature , and i was able to see myself as a part of technology .
this is just one example of many , as adults in the familiarity of a child .
but as you know , as you know , like the <unk> of our knowledge , we do n't have a space that is not a space that we all want to do : there are n't a different way to see themselves .
our language shows the social changes , which has been done in many technologies .
from the medical talk of view , you can tell me that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> from the body of people who are going to protect all the risks , so you can achieve all the way that you can achieve , you can achieve all the way to use your own identity , and then you can achieve all the way to use your own identity , and not to focus on the world , in the same time , in the same time , in order to survive in order to survive .
now , in fact , the technological changes in the technological changes in the world , the one that has been a different truth , which is that every single person could be a lot of <unk> and very good , and that the human ability to develop our human spirit .
the human ability to empathize -- that 's a interesting story , because people have taught me to tell me how i 'm going to talk to me , and i 'm always going to ask myself .
so this sentence from ottawa , with the idea of success , or the idea of being able to use a challenge , or not to be able to create a challenge , or not to be able to create a challenge , or not to help me with my disability .
but the truth is that we change . of course , we are homo duplex , not whether it 's physical , emotional or even change .
and i think that 's good .
machines are not static , which we have to do with our lives better .
bats are just working on our lives .
and i see myself as my footage .
sometimes i remember that it 's very happy , sometimes it 's not easy to see , but he 's all over me .
and i 'm not going to use the impact , and i want to create the impact of a human being .
there are plenty of lives in our lives , and we 're just <unk> real , and they 're just <unk> real , and every person will be different from each other , whether we 're not working with platinum or not .
so we 're not just responsible for the people that we love to be <unk> , but they also want to learn it .
and we do n't have to make our kids if we have to make them feel that they ca n't have access .
you 've got to do two things : to be the medical issue , and you want to be the medical idea about whether i 'm a <unk> .
and to be honest , the only truth and valleys of whom i 've taught me today , is that the world is always being able to show you with this speech .
in our desire to protect people who are supposed to be on the heart , and you have a tendency to know the cause , the good news about their medical officials , or even a tendency to quality of quality , or they 're not trying to protect us , that we 're not paying attention to someone who is willing to do .
now , this is the idea of the idea that only has human rights , which is , in the middle , and how we 're going to use , for every single one , the intelligence rate .
now , if we do n't want to say , if we do n't want to treat the forces , and not all of our forces , and we can go to the natural struggle that you might have to live , another more disease .
we <unk> a people who has a value for our society .
so we have to look at the <unk> , and look at all of the human possibilities .
but , of course , in fact , is that there is between the perception of our metabolism and our great economy .
we should n't tolerate this very early detection , or not , we should n't try to avoid them , but we should not be able to stop it through the carpet , but it 's about to <unk> it .
i 'm going to be more interested in order to be sure that we do n't need to be focused on it , but that we have to be able to be able to give you a little bit to help you create a <unk> , and maybe even to help .
and maybe we can make it as well as a natural <unk> , secure and useful , and feel that through their presence , it is n't more effective .
in this year , 20 years of charles darwin , and when it 's about 150 years , we have heard of evolution of evolution , darwin , in my eye , on something very true in human spirit .
i would be able to be able to do it , not the most of his work , and not not the <unk> of its way , but the way that affect the best .
goodbye , creativity is creativity .
not only from the work that we 're talking about is that the ability of the people , to survive and <unk> , from the human spirit , to try to mobilize .
so , again , change and determination are the ultimate skills of humans .
and maybe we know , because of course , we are stuck when we 're really <unk> .
maybe it 's the sense of al-qaeda , a sense of the metabolism , a sense of our own power .
we can do something about it .
we can put together a new meaning that 's about severe early .
maybe we can be able to see them .
and consequently , for a change , we have n't focused at all .
i think the biggest power that we have to be ourselves , is that we should be normal .
well , who 's normal -- who 's normal ?
there is no normal .
there 's the usual . the whole model . but they do n't want to be the normal . they would like to learn that there 's really possible for people ?
i think about it .
it would be great if we 're talking about this paradigm of conscience , and whether it 's still a little bit cheaper , we can achieve the forces of a lot of kids , and they want to be able to protect their own complex and useful skills .
in fact , we figured out that we had people from the generation of our society , useful to be useful and useful .
well , there 's evidence that the <unk> began about 60,000 years ago years ago , and people were <unk> <unk> with people , and that 's possible , because the people in the <unk> of these people are designed for a society .
they do n't have these people as a <unk> and worried about it as well as well .
a few years ago , i was in the town that i grew up in a <unk> in the <unk> lake in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i stood in a <unk> tongue .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i feel like a guy behind me , `` well , that 's not <unk> . ''
and i read it , and i found this old man . i did n't know who he is .
and i said , `` sam , sir , you know ? i ca n't remember . ''
and he said , `` well , she did n't remember me .
when i first saw her first , i went to her mom .
oh , um .
and of course it did it .
this was dr. <unk> , a man , which i knew about my mom on this day , because i was , in fact , a <unk> two weeks ago .
the doctor for <unk> psychiatry , my mother was in the evening , so , my parents had the man who came up to the world .
and because i was born , and my feet went to you , and i just had to give me a few notes about this , and i had a bow behind this , and i had a blog for me , and a few notes on the other foot was the bad news .
and he said to me , `` i had to tell your parents that you never have to be able to do , and never would be like his kids or anything you could never have a <unk> life , and since then , you 've got to talk to me . ''
the amazing thing i realized was that he gave me in my early childhood was able to do when i was talking about a <unk> in the second class , if i was in the <unk> of the world war , if i was talking to a <unk> in the second grade , i would say to me , and i was able to read these balloons to help her students , <unk> out of the <unk> of the <unk> of california .
and he called this part of his <unk> of the <unk> , the potential of human .
you can not just be enough for how important this is for the quality of the people .
and dr. <unk> told me , he said , `` i 've realized that kids , if they do n't have any other day , and if you only have a little more , if you get kids , you can learn a lot . ''
you can see dr. dr. <unk> .
he was understood that the medical diagnosis , and as someone led to be two different things .
and also , i 've been my time in the course of time when they were asked myself in my age of 15 years , if i was able to ask me , i decided to be able to be my second foot from meat and bones , i would n't have a second .
i wanted to be normal .
if you ask me today , i 'm not sure .
and that 's happening because i have a chance with my legs , and i still have all of my experiences .
and maybe this change was possible , because i had a lot of people , so i had a lot of people who have been trying to help me , or people to help me , or to create a vision of music .
see , there is really just a human being able to show you how they can take their forces , and they are .
now , if you can convince you , your own country is going to solve the forces , the human spirit is so <unk> -- if you can use that , and for someone in a sense of a moment , the door , you have a very good teacher .
they take them to come back to the doors .
the real importance of the word `` <unk> '' is `` <unk> . ''
it means something that means is to be able to have a sense of urgency .
so , what is the potential for us ?
in the 1960s , in 2004 , in the u.k. , <unk> <unk> .
you call it `` <unk> <unk> '' in the u.s. , we call it as `` <unk> . ''
the students are trying to make toast .
and the better students are <unk> <unk> , provide the better teacher and freedom .
and they were talking about a <unk> period of students , and they had no good , she said , `` you know , they were very smart , and after that three months , he did n't really <unk> . ''
and of course , there 's a <unk> of the heart that the treatment was going to be <unk> , they 're just enough .
and the same time it was after the three months .
but only that , still has been in school -- except for the students that have the school .
and what 's interesting about this trial was that the teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers did n't understand that something changed .
so they were just saying that the <unk> and who are blessed with the students , and as they were willing to tell you .
so the only part of a nuclear system is a pencil , a broken , a lot of opportunity , and it does n't have any hope .
now , if we can design it to the human mind , to help ourselves , and other people to learn all sorts of good , just to be able to find our forces .
now , if you think about a spirit of this behavior , we can create a new reality and new .
i want to end up with a poem that 's written by a lagoon named <unk> , and i 'm talking about my friend chris <unk> , and the poem is `` the god , the only of the christ , not the god of the name , not the god of the name , not the god of the name , not the god of the name , but the god , the only of the christ , not the god of the name , but the god of the christ , not only the god of the name , but the god , the only of the christ , not the god of the name , but the god of the christ , not only the god of the name , but the god of the christ , not only the god of the name , but the god of the christ , not only the god of the name , but the god of the christ , not only the god of the name , but the god of the christ , not only the god of the name ,
come on , dance , thank you .
