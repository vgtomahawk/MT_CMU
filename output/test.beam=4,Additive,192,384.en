so steve steve , <unk> of the time of los angeles , one day by the streets of los angeles , she was a wonderful music .
she came from a man , a servant , <unk> , bing , <unk> , who woke up a keyboard , only only two explained .
many of you are aware of this story , because in <unk> paper , was a book that was <unk> , <unk> robert <unk> , and <unk> <unk> as a <unk> paul <unk> , the <unk> , who started to <unk> and <unk> <unk> as a <unk> encyclopedia , the <unk> , who started to <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , alex , a <unk> and 30 years later , he was used as a train at the streets of <unk> <unk> .
and i 'm showing you all of the rest of the <unk> , or the movie look at this film , and it 's not just the wonderful connection , that between these two men , or the way that music is able to understand the connection between these two men , but the way that the music has made these relationship with these two men , but how they finally have the instrument , and when they read the instrument , if it 's a <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> ,
i met dr. <unk> <unk> in 2004 , two years ago , in august st. <unk> .
he had just been a grant from venezuela 's law and burger king , and he went behind the stage to describe me .
he spoke in a very <unk> and <unk> of the mother and <unk> , and israel , and talking about how scripture did n't get into the <unk> world , and all of this is because of all of the <unk> <unk> of the last sentence of <unk> arts .
and we went to talk to me , and a few days later , i got a email where i was thinking about a <unk> , for me .
i also had to say that apple is a medical treatment , because he was already with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and a smart person who got his entire life .
now , when a result of this is , you know , when you 're talking about these frustration , and that 's sometimes as bad , and it 's asleep in the streets of <unk> <unk> , and this is the <unk> of his own mind .
and in fact , in a very funny room , it was <unk> , when we were talking with our first day , we saw the posters that we were seeing with the hudson <unk> , and he had this mad filter in his eyes and lost it .
he was talking about invisible athletes and smoke and talking about how someone wants to leave to sleep .
i did n't know , not , because i was afraid that i could get to lose him , that he would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get him into a relationship , and then i started to talk about <unk> and <unk> .
so i started trying to play .
i played the first sentence of <unk> <unk> .
and as i was doing , i started to see that in <unk> eyes , a lot of change .
it was as if he was <unk> by the power of his science , a chemical response to be a game .
<unk> <unk> bone marrow began to find out , in a quiet curiosity ,
and as a miracle , he took his neck , and started to listen to some of these clips of play , and asked me to play her , `` <unk> , <unk> .
so we started to talk about music , starting from all of a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and all the other creeds , from <unk> to <unk> .
and i realized that he did n't just have a knowledge of music , but it took me to make a tight personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding of my colleagues in the conferences of los angeles .
when he was doing music , and over the time , there was this <unk> , <unk> man , who was still in the streets of los angeles .
music is medicine . music makes us .
it 's music to be <unk> health .
because the music allows him to read his thoughts and control with his imagination and creativity .
and so he <unk> his <unk> .
i understood that exactly the nature of art .
this is the reason why we do music : this is how we can do it in all of us , so , in our sense , our feelings , through our evolutionary metabolism , through our creativity .
and the reality of the mechanics is coming to us , and moves , inspired and forth .
and so , as a <unk> , all of the music , put him the music back into a community of friends .
the <unk> force of the music he took him back in a family of the people who helped him understand him , and he sells himself .
and i 'm always going to be able to do yoga with a musician , if you can <unk> <unk> , i 'm going to be <unk> , and i 'm afraid of myself , i 'm sorry for myself .
thank you very much .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
<unk> se .
robert gallo : i want to play a little bit i 'm going to <unk> the <unk> .
i hope you guys .
so i have a lot of fish in many life .
i just have a love .
this first , that was more than a grateful .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good , <unk> , a castle on the apartments .
what 's a fish .
so better , it was used in <unk> to the highest law of sustainability .
so you could feel feeling to sell it .
i had with this beauty a few months .
one day , the head of a company , and asked if i was talking about a gentleman in the farm .
`` of course , i said .
so this was a company that was trying to solve what this needed for our iphones , how do we train fish ?
in the last 50 years , we 've got the oceans where we have tropical <unk> .
it 's hard to visualize the destruction .
<unk> percent of the big fish that we love , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , they 're protected .
it 's almost nothing left .
so , you can think about whether or not <unk> , <unk> , part of our future .
a lot of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> the environment , most of them , and they are resilient , so we 're <unk> .
he has a <unk> from chicago .
that means , for a hundred pounds of organs , you need to be a pound controller .
not very sustainable .
otherwise , not so good .
so here 's a company that was trying to do it right .
i wanted to get them .
at the day of the event , i called the head of the <unk> for the company .
let 's say him .
`` mommy , '' i said , `` only about the facts are right , you 're famous for the outside world that you have to know the environment . ''
`` the right thing , he says . `` we are so far outside the <unk> of our fish , not jealous . ''
and then he <unk> it , `` we are basically a whole world .
this is from the <unk> of chicago .
`` the best in the business . ''
<unk> to a great , great .
`` <unk> , '' what 's your quality ?
`` carbon proteins , '' he said .
`` great , '' i said .
and on this evening , i was in bed in my bed , and i thought , `` what is hell ?
so i called the next day , short of the event , painting .
and i said , `` well , what is the cost proteins ? ''
he said he does n't . he 's gon na say .
well , i 'm going to talk to a couple of people in the company ; nobody could give me a <unk> response . so i went to the <unk> biologists .
let 's also call it again .
`` aah , '' i said , `` what is about <unk> proteins ? ''
well , he said some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , `` <unk> ? ''
he said , `` yes , temperature , skin , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . ''
i said , `` how much oil of the <unk> is a gun ? ''
in the assumption , maybe two percent .
`` well , that 's about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , `` daddy , what 's useful for him chicken ? ''
there was a long time in the world , and he said , `` there is easy to come out there . ''
i <unk> myself .
no , not , because i 'm a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
this is me .
no , i 've been <unk> out of this fish , because i 'm talking about god , the fish for him .
this second fish , which is another kind of <unk> .
it 's the romantic sort of sense , which is that you 're going to take your fish , you take the fish .
i met it in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> boy had a long time for the fish .
it 's actually <unk> us .
he came up on a table , almost <unk> white color .
he gave him <unk> .
<unk> twice .
he was still delicious .
who can make a fish like that , who he was <unk> ?
i can not do it , but this guy can .
let 's call him sin . in fact , it 's called google .
and no , he does n't have the fish , and it 's not a chef . at the way you understand , and i understand them .
he 's a biologist at <unk> de <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner .
it 's over the <unk> of the river .
and in the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of <unk> .
they were <unk> <unk> on what they discovered .
they did this by turning the land .
they built these little <unk> of chemotherapy , and they were making water out of the land ,
well , they could n't change that was done , not sustainable .
and security is a catastrophe .
it took about 90 percent of the birds of what they were on .
and so , again , a <unk> company with the country .
what did they do ?
they have the <unk> of the water .
they literally <unk> the <unk> .
instead of the water <unk> , they used to <unk> the water .
they <unk> the <unk> .
they created a <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and they have breast cancer , and his company , the <unk> destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you 've never seen anything .
and you 're looking at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see is <unk> <unk> ,
i did n't have a long time ago .
he 's a big guy , three parts charles darwin and a part of a supermodel .
okay ? so , we were talking about , and we went through the waterfall and we were <unk> and <unk> , put it up to my elephant , and hans showed up in the face .
this is what he is wearing a rare <unk> .
now he 's going to keep the <unk> of eden .
and here , there 's a pattern that brings him to the <unk> .
it turns out that hans has been the largest part of his career in the <unk> museum in africa .
i asked him how he got to be a <unk> .
he said , `` do you get fish ? i do n't know .
i 'm an expert for relationships . ''
and then it goes , and it 's going to be <unk> by more birds and sisters .
and do n't get me wrong , that 's really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community , in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was <unk> about this <unk> piece of <unk> that i did .
so , i 've got it to me . i said , `` rachel , and how did you get your fish ? ''
he showed up with the algae .
`` i know , boy , the algae , the <unk> , that 's incredible .
but what do your blood pressure ?
how is the <unk> ? ''
now , he told me to tell you that it is so much a <unk> that the fish eat what they eat in the wild .
the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , which is what the fish is .
the system is so healthy , it 's completely <unk> .
there is no food .
who 's heard about a farm that do n't paint them ?
now , after the day , i went on this piece of gloves , and i asked him , i said , `` well , how much as a place i was , `` how did you learn ? ''
in the moment , it was when a <unk> person had to offer you .
and we put on the corner , and we 're looking at the top of the thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of wood , and it 's so sharp .
`` that 's success , '' he said .
`` look at your bellies , pink .
they 're <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was totally confused .
i said , `` did you know your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we take 20 percent of our fish and <unk> the birds .
now , last year , at this dialogue , 300 birds , more than 1.2 different kinds of different species .
it 's the largest and one of the most successful private fund in europe .
i said , `` greg , '' is that the last person you have to have in a bookstore ? ''
he tasted his head , no .
he said , `` we 're building <unk> .
this is a major network .
the eiffel lights of the <unk> .
the shopkeepers eat the <unk> .
so the phoenix islands is the system . ''
okay , let 's look at this . a farm that does n't interact with their genes , and a farm that connects us in their health care .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and of course , not just tearing that miscarriage .
they breed in a city of 4,000 kilometers , where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning you 're about 12,000 miles .
and every night , they 're about 12,000 miles .
they do it because they can be the <unk> white of the <unk> .
in fact .
and i was looking at a sort of journey of the penguins , so i looked behind .
i said , `` bill , come on 4,000 miles to come in and forth ? ''
do you do it for the kids ? ''
he looked at me when i was a song from david <unk> .
he said , `` no . you make it because the food is better . ''
i did n't have the skin of my dog 's , and i 'm not a <unk> . i do n't know her .
it 's this <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
i 'm not going to never forget about it .
and yet , when i was trying to do it in this restaurant , you did n't have to <unk> her <unk> .
they felt cute , and it would be like if you put a drop of the ocean .
i mentioned that it woke up , and he recommends .
he said , `` the skin looks like a glass .
it 's the last mile before it 's in the body .
it has developed all over the <unk> of <unk> .
and then he <unk> up , `` but our water has no <unk> . ''
okay . a farm that kills their fish . a farm that brings them to a <unk> of their <unk> .
and then i realized , when he says , a farm that 's not a <unk> , it 's kind of <unk> water , because the water that comes through this farm .
it 's a river , which is all the things that are communicating to the animal , but it 's used to be chemical <unk> , solar panels .
and if it 's dependent on the system , and it 's the water temperature of water as it is <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not in a farm that does n't use their animals , not only a farm that is literally a <unk> , and not only for those fish , but it 's not only for those fish .
because when the water is <unk> , it 's in the atlantic .
a leader in the ocean , i know , but i 'm going to take it , and that 's what you want to do , because these <unk> , as unexpected as it is , in fact , is needles .
you could say that it 's a recipe for the future , whether we 're talking about <unk> or <unk> .
now , what we need is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food also well .
but for many people , it 's a little bit of action .
we 're not <unk> ; we 're <unk> . we 're <unk> .
we love <unk> . we love small <unk> . we love about local food . we eat .
and if you 're saying that , things are the future , i think somebody wakes up , and says , `` hey people , i love the law for <unk> , but how are you going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? ''
can i be honest ?
i do n't like this question .
no , not , because we have enough calories to create more than just .
one billion people are going to talk today .
one billion -- this is more than ever before -- because the <unk> delta in the distribution , not the <unk> .
well , i do n't like this question because it 's the logic of our <unk> rate last week .
so , onscreen movements in <unk> , <unk> on the ground , google , <unk> , and the whole time , we have a chance to stop the kaaba , `` why can possibly be ? ''
this was the <unk> . it was the <unk> . it was the <unk> of the american agriculture .
what we should call is what is it is , in a <unk> , a <unk> , that 's because of the production .
this is not a leap , it 's not agriculture .
our <unk> is today , not because <unk> <unk> , but because of public resources .
not <unk> by the newest <unk> and <unk> , but by british land , not by flapping water , but by the water , and not by <unk> and water , but through fish .
they want to feed the world ?
let 's start with the question : how do we feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create the basis that make a community for itself ?
to do that , look at the <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's gone .
education , chemistry and machines are in the <unk> , and it does n't have to be really good for food .
let 's go to the <unk> model .
this is the equivalent of two billion years .
look for smallpox , farmers like google .
afghanistan , these are not the same for themselves , doctors , who are trying to cure drugs , drugs , the <unk> , rather than <unk> , who are not just connected , but experts for relationships .
because they are these people who are experts .
and when i 'm really honest , you 're a better treat when i 'm ever .
you know , this is me , because if the future is good , you will be fired .
thank you .
now , if i want to do one of the time , it 's the power of the data that we have to be bigger than the sum of their senses and instead of thinking about what i want to think about how you can use information as well as we can use information , and so you can see that we can adapt to realize that it would n't be visible .
so what 's what we see is a <unk> <unk> for old age .
so the program that i use here is a little experiment .
it 's called <unk> , and what i can do with <unk> is that i can use it to a certain set of what we call .
and then i look at a pattern , and this is what you see .
and that is because in the <unk> of the people here , and they are over there .
we can take a step back and zoom in the data , and look at the data , and the fact that <unk> and cancer are the normal vatican , but not for everyone .
now , if we 're going to continue to work , for example , we 'll be 40 years , or we can get 40 years or so we can see that the laws is going to talk about the people .
and that <unk> shows that it 's particularly interesting to men .
so you can see that the way of information and data in this way , in this sense of swimming in a different <unk> .
and if we can do this for information , why ca n't matter for content ?
now , what we have here are the <unk> of every single group called the number of nests that have ever been put together .
it 's all right . it 's all the online .
you can try to talk to my talk .
you can buy it in a decade .
you can peel on a particular year .
you can read directly to a certain show .
now , when i look at here , i see the athlete that look inside this palette .
i 'm a regular <unk> of this , so i 'm going to show you all the only thing that i 'm going to show up in my inbox .
now , if i want to make a <unk> of this , i could say , ok , what do i do with the subject ? ''
so i 'm going to take a step back and <unk> it .
now , i see 55,000 <unk> .
and so you get a idea of that , if you get on this kind of information , you know , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , if you do n't just sit or <unk> .
you do something that 's actually a bit different .
it 's something between , and we think it changes the way .
now , i want to leave this idea of what 's a little bit crazy .
what we 've done here is , we 've created every single light bulb , and it has contributed to a small level .
and the only one is a quick visualization and a symbol for the area of it .
i 'm just going to take the top 500 million of the <unk> .
but even in this demonstration , we can do a lot of things .
and then we get a sense of the themes that are based on wikipedia .
so i 'm going to argue the theme of a magician .
now , after i 've mentioned <unk> , i know that the <unk> of the world who are working on most of the <unk> are the people in the year .
this is really important because it 's a realization that is not in a single <unk> .
that 's just to see if you take a step and look at the whole time .
so , at a recent side of the <unk> , i can go into the subject of the year , and you can see all of them .
now , if i look at all of these people , i know that the majority of you are there , the majority of science , and some of the science is , i 've got to do it , and one of my life .
and interestingly , a ted teacher won .
so , you can see , and look at all ted talk .
you see , if you look at the web , the first time you see is the web , not only from the side , but it 's a lot more .
and so i 'd like to show you what a little surprise .
so i 'm going to show you now just the new york times .
<unk> , this method -- i do n't want to be a browser ; it 's really not a browser ; it 's really not a browser , but you can call the <unk> to each other software .
so , i can go back to you , and i 'm looking at a similar <unk> .
so this is really important because you can just look through the <unk> of the molecules in the way that you can look at the same way .
so , i can zoom in my initial slides .
this is where the whole demonstration i 've been working on .
and i can do everything that i 've been working on today , again .
and so , if i take a step forward , and i can look at anything , i can find my studies today , and i 'm going to talk to myself , i 'm going to talk to myself , or here , i 'm going to talk about in sports .
and that 's what i can go back in front of you .
it 's a metaphor that 's going to happen again , and every time it makes the whole range of bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
right now , in this world , we think the data is a garden .
we talk about the <unk> of the <unk> .
we 're talking about opec 's information .
what if we could put this situation , and the internet on the head is that we 're always going to go from a little bit , we have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do some of the things that we had to be able to get into a lot of things .
if we can do this , this process is going to be able to create this kind of building information for a different source .
and , instead of trying to move into information , we can learn from it .
and if we know , if we can understand , we can even educate .
so i 'm listening to thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> scientific science .
in my hometown , i went to school , every day every hour .
and my nose continued always in a book , a <unk> , who loves my thoughts in other worlds , and in my sense , my <unk> in my life , i 'm sure , <unk> <unk> .
and this curiosity , however , that i was always when i was not in school , by the forests of the city , <unk> and radio and <unk> and <unk> and blood and <unk> and light and <unk> , and under the microscope .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and the boundaries of the mistakes .
and my love to science fiction was in my neighborhood , because at the late '60s , i went to the moon , and we have the deep sea .
mark kennedy <unk> came in our living room with his extraordinary <unk> that we 've been able to communicate and animals and places that we had never imagined before .
this is what it looks like this is <unk> .
and i was artists .
i could read . i could play .
and i do n't want to play video games with these <unk> <unk> with <unk> films , and so the whole mathematics in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
so we had to do this . if we had a book , we were able to take a book , and we had the description of the <unk> and gave them on the screen in our heads .
and my response to me was the face and the mob of religious , religious worlds , religious , and things like this .
in the middle , i was always touched by the teacher , and i was looking at the microphone in my inbox .
the creativity had to be stopped .
and what happened in this is something interesting , which is what i 've been talking about to <unk> <unk> , is that the one of us , and it was a lot of the world in our world itself .
now , i would never get a <unk> world with a <unk> , so that seemed to me .
but this is a world that i 've been able to read here on the earth , and she was able to find interesting , and i found myself as all the things that i 've been able to read this books .
so i decided when i was 15 , <unk> .
the only problem i was in a small village in canada , one meter from the next sea .
but i did n't cry .
i called my father , until it started to make a <unk> in <unk> , new york , where he was done in the other side of the neighborhood .
i took my <unk> in a library of <unk> in the middle of winter in the middle of the middle of the middle of winter , new york .
but the ocean , however , we have two years later , when we went to california .
in fact , in the 40 years , i 've spent about 20 hours of water , 500 hours of it .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the <unk> ocean , is so many of the life is how we really understood .
the world 's nature does n't solve boundaries , particularly in our own , human human imagination .
and at the time of time , i 'm listening to the buddha of what i see on my <unk> .
and my love to the ocean is the same intensity as well .
so when i was as an adult , it was the <unk> .
so this was the best opportunity to read my inner job , stories to help me to create images .
as a child , i was always talking about it , and so .
so , the movies were pictures and pictures and stories about this .
of course , the stories that i gave me from the <unk> : `` <unk> , '' and `` <unk> . ''
in the <unk> , i was able to take my <unk> for the <unk> , and that 's what i call it .
so my new passions takes me .
so , what 's interesting is about <unk> , to create a <unk> problem in this film -- and we had to do so we had a kind of <unk> <unk> -- so we went to <unk> animation .
and what was happening , the first cloned <unk> that ever saw in a movie .
now the movie did n't have a robot , right , he was just going to be able to look at his <unk> , but i found something fascinating : the audience on the world , as <unk> from the sound of this .
according to islam , however , is <unk> technology , and it is not more than any other .
so they saw something beautiful .
and that was what i became incredibly exciting .
and i thought , `` wow , that 's got to be in the wheels . ''
so , we went to `` jeopardy '' in my next film , another little bit .
together with stained selection , we gave the guy out of liquid , there 's about how this effect came up .
and it worked , again , we had something magical , and the impact in the audience was the same thing , but we 've been working with the movie a little bit of money .
so , in these two experiences , one of the world has been a new world for a new world of creativity .
so , i was a company where i was working with my good friend <unk> , who was on the time of the best <unk> and <unk> . it was `` <unk> . ''
and the idea of this company was a period of starting to <unk> the effluent of bindis , etc. , and looking at digital spaces .
and so we did it , and we 're trying to do it for a while .
but in the 1990s , we realized that we went to the <unk> and <unk> -- which we had actually been able to work for a while .
and i had this piece called `` yes '' written by the <unk> of the new haven , '' <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> should be all <unk> .
but the centerline of it was very late . and the people in my company said that we would not be able to build this together .
so , i went to , and i saw this other film about the big ship , which is happening .
the <unk> i was like , `` <unk> and juliet morning on a ship , '' it was a <unk> <unk> , a funny film .
but i was also trying to find the real barrier of the titanic .
that 's what i did .
this is the truth . the studio did n't .
i did it , and i decided to say , `` we go to the supermarket . we stop the answer .
we 'll show it in the <unk> of the movie .
this is important . it 's a good <unk> for marketing . ''
and i <unk> them to make a <unk> .
it 's crazy . but that 's back to the back of the back of the real imagination .
and i built this six months later , i think , in fact , i think , in fact , i think , in fact , a lot of reality , where i was in a russian team , four kilometers under the surface of the north pole , and i saw the real titanic through a <unk> .
that was not a movie , no <unk> , that was real .
so that 's what i really did .
and the most important thing we 've had to do was created . we had to take cameras and circle and everything .
and i noticed , as a result of these <unk> , a <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
you get into the storm , you 're in the dark , remote environments , where there are no hope to prevent if you do n't go back .
and i thought , `` wow , that 's the same time when i was in a <unk> .
that 's really cool . ''
i was curious about the study of the deep sea .
anyway , in the part of the good and science , it was all about it , it was curiosity .
and it was a experience that gave me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could make a visual effect , but i could n't be able to imagine what i could see outside of the <unk> .
now , some of the things that i found out in the meantime , and sometimes the things that i had never seen before , sometimes the things that i 've never seen before , and i did n't have any words .
so that 's what i was doing , and i wanted to do more .
and so i ended up a little bit .
after the success of the titanic , i said , `` okay , i want to take my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood on a <unk> , '' and i was <unk> for a while . ''
and then we started , we called the <unk> , and we got them with <unk> .
and we went to the top of the titanic .
we used little robot that we had built into a <unk> .
our poetry was <unk> , and the <unk> of the ship was done before .
no one ever had the inside of the <unk> . you had no idea of doing it . so we had the transition technology .
well , and so , i 'm looking at the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and look at the <unk> , which is a little bit like me , and i know that once the band is completed .
and i read with a little <unk> of the <unk> of the ship .
i 'm actually suggesting that , but my consciousness is within the computer .
it felt like when i was living in the <unk> of the titanic .
this was the <unk> form of a <unk> that i 've ever seen . because before i went on a corner , i was always looking at what was happening on the edge of the knee , because i was in the <unk> .
and this one was a true interview of the <unk> of the <unk> .
so that was a very useful experience .
and it made me to realize that , you know , using these <unk> , that you can use these <unk> behaviors , and so this is your own mind in the vehicle , in these other forms of existence .
it was really deeply efficient .
and perhaps a little bit reminiscent of what could happen in some decades , if you 've got to have something to find something , or other things , in all sorts of things that i can imagine .
so , at this point , we started to think about what we saw on the bottom , we 've seen this incredibly complex animals , and we were able to see these incredibly complex animals .
they live with stories .
they do n't exist in a <unk> system as we do .
and so you can see animals that are sitting next to a 500 acres of light that you can survive .
at the same time , i was very interested in <unk> , that was the <unk> of my childhood .
and so , i went on to people who have been talking about space , and the people talk about , and i 'm going to do with the <unk> , and i think about the <unk> of the <unk> , and i think about the <unk> of the <unk> , and i 'm going to go to the <unk> <unk> ,
this is fascinating .
but at the end , it turned out that i was <unk> with the <unk> valley .
and i took them with them , and i put them into the world , because of course , <unk> , people who were punished for these <unk> situations , and i took them through the sources of their antigens , and take them back to their <unk> , and so forth .
we were <unk> , but actually , science , really , science , <unk> .
so the circle between my existence as nursing as a child , and the opportunities in the reality .
in the meantime , i have a lot of learning .
i have a lot about science , but i think there can be a <unk> , a leader , like a <unk> , or so .
but i do n't mind , but i do n't think of it , before i do this attachment .
because in a particular point , i had to say , `` what do i do ?
why do i do that ? what 's going on ? ''
this is that little <unk> do n't help us .
we 're just obeying the <unk> , and we 're not going to get out of air .
all right , i think between the titanic , and i said , `` compromise , '' and `` lean '' or `` '' and `` i 'm going to go on a piece of the beach . ''
i 've all made this films , this leak , for a very small audience .
no pavement , no way , no money . what do you do ?
you 're doing it to the challenge , and the ocean is the <unk> environment , and because of the strange connection , which means when a small group of people have a team .
because we 've got all this with only 10 to 12 people that we know , we had two to three months in the morning .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing that you can imagine , because you have a task , you can not do something else .
and if you go to land , and you say , `` you know , i said , `` we 've got to do , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the whole thing that human beings , if you look at the holidays , you can not be able to look at the other hand , and that 's what 's going on in the morning , and you can not get the other one .
there 's a connection , a giraffe .
so when i went back to my next film , `` trust , '' i decided to use the same kind of task that you use his team ,
this is really changed .
so , i said , with a small team on the site , we were called `` avatar '' with a new technology that would n't be before .
very exciting .
a huge challenge .
and we were in a while , for about three years .
it changed my way to make movies .
there were people who thought that we were able to do this <unk> , really well , and it was <unk> .
for me , it was a more important way to do my job , the real process that was changed in .
so what can we do about all this ?
what did we learn ?
i think the first place is gratefulness .
it 's the most important human property .
our language is a power that even even have a reality .
and the bleaching of the team is more important than all the world .
so to my wife 's boy , the guy who say , `` do you give me a way i can do . ''
and i say , `` do n't tell you .
the wires are other for you . do n't tell you all , you do n't care about it . you get risks .
nasa did n't have a <unk> . it says , `` asshead is not a disaster . ''
but in the art and the other hand , there is also an alternative , because there is a <unk> .
no big deal with innovation , which innovation is invented a lot .
you have to be willing to take these risks .
this is the idea that i want to leave you with . she 's totally an alternative , scared , fear .
today i 'm talking to you about energy and climate .
and it 's something that might be something like this , because my favorite therapist work on the foundation for autism and malaria , and the things that we create , and we need to create the poorest two billion dollars .
but energy and climate are incredibly important for those people , because most importantly than any other on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> are often about a few years , not , we can do a lot of them , or not to make a lot of them . the things that are going to be able to change their neurologic environment .
it leads to uncertainty .
so , it 's a great curiosity for them .
and also , it 's also really important for them .
the fact is , if you only have one of the price , it would be the energy of the energy system .
well , the <unk> is about the time .
in fact , it 's actually <unk> 's <unk> .
the <unk> of the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a <unk> case in the <unk> , and so we have <unk> materials and so many things .
so we are in a wonderful view of electricity in the rich world .
but , if we get the price , we 're going to take the price in a million star , and that proportion to each other .
co2 is the planet and the equation for co2 is actually pretty simple .
they <unk> the <unk> co2 , which is the <unk> , and this predictability has a lot of negative effects . the ones on the weather and perhaps worse , the <unk> , that the natural ecosystems that can not evolve and make all the systems .
well , the same boat between a <unk> and the source of the <unk> and where they have another consequences have there , there are some non-linear organizations , but not very many .
and there 's certainly <unk> about how bad these will be . but they 're extremely bad .
so , we 've been asked for the <unk> long , `` do we need to go down to zero ?
is n't half of time or a living ? ''
the answer is , until we go to zero , the temperature goes on .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's pretty different to us , we have a <unk> long high truck , which has to come up at a three feet of the system .
this is to go to zero .
well , we 're going to spend a bunch of carbon dioxide from about 12,000 billion tons .
every americans spends about 20 tons of people from poor countries , less than one .
in the average , it 's about five tons for each other .
and somehow , we need to use changes in zero .
it 's about 300,000 .
now , we have different economic changes , and we 've got to get rid of poverty , and to have a democratic dose of zero .
this equation has four rules , a little bit of carbon , and you have this thing on the planet , co2 -- that you can do with zero to each other , the average energy for every drug , and the co2 , which will be 1,000 <unk> .
so , let 's take each of a matter of time , and we think we 're going to do it in zero .
now , you have to have a look at a lot of zero to zero .
now , this is <unk> , but let 's go .
we first have the population .
today , 2.1 billion people .
and it 's to work on nine billion .
if we 're very successful with new regimes , the <unk> and <unk> , we could do this for 10 percent to 40 percent , but at the time , we see a slope of recovery .
the second factor are the fuel we use .
this is all about food that we eat , clothing , tv .
these are very good things , and it means that they 're almost every single person on the planet .
it 's great that this number is going .
in the developing world , in the upper city , we could take it more and more likely to do that , but in the average , that number one year every year , and it will be more than 20 , the average of the cost of the vehicles .
what we see here is a very <unk> service . it 's at the light that you can read the homework ?
and these students have n't , so you go and read your <unk> under the <unk> .
now , in retrospect , the e , the energy per mile , there is good news .
we have something that does n't happen .
there 's a lot of different successes in the <unk> , with other forms of new methods , there are a lot of lentils to attract their money around 90 percent .
in other <unk> , like the lack of <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> or <unk> , or the <unk> or <unk> , or the legs for work very much smaller .
in fact , if we 're optimistic , we 'll have a choice for three or maybe even a factor .
but in the first three factors , we are now talking about 26 billion pounds , and that 's not surprising .
so , in fact , we have the fourth factor -- and this is a nuclear weapon -- this is the amount of co2 , which is a continuous commodity .
it turns out that if you can do that .
if you get coal , no .
if you do n't have natural gas : no .
almost every <unk> of electricity , all of these areas are co2 , except for renewables ,
so , what we need to do is to have a global level is to create a new system .
we need collusion .
now , when i say the word `` god , '' i do n't understand .
this is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and its contribution is a miracle .
the people in this case of many of these miracles .
normally , though , there 's no shortcut that you have to have a miracle to a certain level .
normally you are just looking at the top of your life , and you can not look at it .
now , in this case , we have to be <unk> , and a miracle of very long time .
well , i thought , how could i do that ?
is there a natural way , a evidence that the idea of people here ?
i feel like last year , i decided to do , and i always liked people .
the idea was really important , you know , there are people who were working on .
for energy , this is what i was doing .
and i decided that the <unk> of drugs would be the <unk> of the environment .
so here 's a few natural candles .
you 've told me that they do n't cry . do n't think you 're going to get the glass .
well , there are all sorts of notes like this , but they do n't own all .
we need a lot of solutions , either one or a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of scale , and even more importantly , and most importantly , if you look at the same time , i think we 've done five years that do this great leader .
i have <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
and there 's a profound contribution , and if you want to be better than i expect , the great thing , but my integrity here is that we have to work on all of the five work , and we can not understand from them , because everyone has universal problems .
now , if we look at the top of fossil fuels , the <unk> of our plants or natural gas .
what you need to do is perhaps just , but that 's not . you need to take all the co2 , which is to be <unk> by the <unk> , you know , through pressure , and then sit there .
there is a couple of studies that are going on a $ 100 percent -- 80 percent of it , but it 's too hard to be easy . and a chance to be able to be a very important challenge .
who will use it ?
who can play something out of how many ships are much more than any species of waste that you can learn from clusters and other things ?
that 's a lot of time .
so this is a tough <unk> .
next , <unk> .
now , the whole lot of problems , the cost of all , in the world , in many countries , high seas in the world , in the world , the amount of certainty that you can do n't even feel secure , despite the human activity , which is not sustainable .
and what do you do with that ?
because even though it 's not very big , there 's a lot of view .
so three and more important problems that are wealthy are , and that 's what they should do .
the last three of the five days i 've done .
it 's the adult land , as you often .
and , of course , even though it 's not , they have no force -- they have some clues .
one is the <unk> that are used to use these technologies that are used as a <unk> .
these are <unk> , you know from many <unk> , 1,000 times as a normal power .
now , these are these tools to use these sources .
the sun does n't seem like all day , and it does n't seem like everyone else , and the synapses that you do n't get the wind .
and so , you have to get out of these sources , a way that you can do , but it is n't available .
so there are big <unk> . there are challenges in the field when we say that the energy outside the country is , they do n't only have the technology , they have to be the technology for the risk that the energy of all .
and there 's the <unk> .
and to use the dimension , i have all of these kinds of devices that we have to do : the problem of cars , computers , computers , computers , mobile phones , computers , cell phones , and use that , and that 's what i 've done is less than 10 minutes of decolonization .
so we need to be a big breakthrough here , something that is going to be a factor of a better than the probability of time .
it 's not impossible , but it 's not so easy .
this is , when you try to take these <unk> miles away , we 'll spend 20 percent -- 30 percent of the earth .
if you want to spend 100 percent of it , you need a incredible <unk> .
now where are we going to say , what is the right approach ?
a `` third project '' like , how do we go ?
what we need is a lot of companies that work for us .
in each of these five domains , we need to spend 100 years .
so , you 'll tell you , you 're crazy ! that 's good .
i think there are many people who are there there .
bill 's got a lot of companies , among other words , a great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invest in dozens of companies who are the great things , and interesting opportunities have been , and i try to support this .
nathan myhrvold and i 'm going to be a company that , perhaps , without the lack of approach .
there are some innovations in the <unk> ; t , finland .
so the development is in this industry , a few years ago , so it 's not a big surprise , some of us are good .
the <unk> means that you 're going to use one percent of the world , which is one percent , the <unk> , we decided to reduce the 99 percent to fuel .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , if you had a little bit about it , but you could never find swiftly on it , but it was all about <unk> , you can see it , but you 've seen modern , you see it .
and because you see that 99 percent matter , it is very much better .
in fact , you can get the <unk> of today , and you can also get the <unk> of animals .
instead of looking at the head , get it . a great thing .
the tailings ponds will be used to be a little bit clumsy .
you can see it 's a kind of <unk> , often as a wave of this .
this is really the <unk> .
this is a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the <unk> , which is 99 percent . you have the part of which today , so it 's called corrupt <unk> .
this is the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you 're <unk> <unk> , and just <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there 's a lot of challenges , but it 's an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move .
let 's think about how to measure our success .
what would our <unk> look like ?
now , let 's go up to the target that we need to do , and we 'll talk about the <unk> .
a lot of about 80 percent reduction in 2050 .
it 's really important to us .
the rest of 20 percent are going to be rich in poor countries , and it 's going to be affordable , hopefully , and it 's going to be <unk> .
so , to do this 80 percent reduction in the world , including the developed , including countries like china .
the other note says , if we can use the <unk> technology , whether it 's in all the countries we have in the world .
that 's great .
this is a key to this proposition .
now , if we go back in , what would we look at the sun ?
it should be the two elements .
we should use the <unk> , to use the way to use the way that we need to be <unk> , the more likely to be the <unk> and the energy temperature .
but in fact , this is for the things that we 're using companies that are not entirely to the big <unk> , only in the same , or even more important than the other aspect of innovation .
this drone has to have to protect us with <unk> , and that 's what we can measure .
there are many great books in this topic .
the al gore 's book , `` david <unk> , '' `` david <unk> <unk> the earth . ''
it 's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do that , because we need to be <unk> by all sides .
there is a lot that we have .
this is a wish .
a very ambitious desire to make this technology .
if you just have a wish for the next 50 years , i could take the president , a <unk> , and i love this desire , which is , the <unk> , you can not be able to be able to do this desire , the <unk> , without <unk> , without the desire .
this has the biggest impact .
now , if we do n't think about this desire , it will be between 400 and a half people who are terrible , whereas the u.s. and china , between three and rich countries .
so what do we have to do ?
what are the things i do ?
we need to keep ourselves for more .
now , when countries go in places like <unk> , they should not just talk about co2 .
and you would want to talk about these <unk> , and they were going to be <unk> by the <unk> , kind of , you know , for these kinds of standards .
we need <unk> , carbon <unk> , <unk> & amp ; d it 's something that a <unk> system .
we have to accelerate the message .
we need to make a lot of <unk> and <unk> , and the things that come up by the government .
it 's an important wish , but i think we can .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you .
thank you very much for us to do something better -- exactly , can you have an idea of the content of this investment ?
bill gates : and what we 've got to measure the simulation on a mammogram , all the scientists scientists have done , we have only a few million dollars . and even if we have our materials in a <unk> , to ensure that it 's going to happen .
and the hard step step is , the hard step is to create a billion billions of living , the <unk> , and the place of the world 's built .
when the first step is , when it 's like , it 's all very clear , because the innovation , the <unk> , as well as we know .
so to understand this is : how does it grow to go on the ground as small charge of the <unk> , this guy , and then there 's going to go back to the bottom ?
bg : right . now , you have to get out there , you know , there 's a lot of people , and a lot of people who are going to go , and that 's where you can throw it , and things like , or whatever .
now , if you 're very cheap , you can take it for 60 years , you think of a wall -- that she 's able to get a whole bunch of rules .
and it 's sitting there , and it 's <unk> , and it 's gone .
a nuclear weapon that keeps us a solution to the reef .
bg : yeah . so what 's going on to the cloud : you can take it -- there 's a lot of damage with this method -- and then you take it into the next space .
and we 're looking for through the <unk> that we 've done in this <unk> or <unk> in the circulation . this is our <unk> .
so this is what it 's been a problem , and what we 've done in our face , and it 's produced by the world 's developed as this process .
but while they share with different people in the world .
where is the biggest interest in this way .
bg : well , we have n't been on a place , and there 's a lot of interesting <unk> for all of this company in the name . there are big interest , and the people of the company were in afghanistan , india , china -- i was here in the world , and we talk about how this is to take it .
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and the teacher has done something .
this is an architect one thing that was done .
this is a big step forward , but it 's like a faster and a new light , and so every one , every one , every single one , that it 's a <unk> place for our first .
in the idea , for the way , a lot of a chance to live in life ?
bg : now we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we 've got 20 years to be <unk> and then 20 years .
this is the <unk> that we have to do the <unk> that we need to communicate .
and , you know , <unk> , if all of good matter , and that 's a great wish , it might be easy .
and luckily , there are dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of thousands of companies that are capable , for the evolution that work for their industry , for example .
and it would be in the best if there 's a pair of information , because then you could use a mixture .
in any case , we need a solution .
does the number of gamers , is this the biggest you know ?
bg : a <unk> is the <unk> .
that would be no without the <unk> , but it 's so much more important .
there are other <unk> companies .
you know , we do n't know what do n't think about this , but there 's the <unk> method that 's another idea .
there 's a spectacular subsidy that 's hard to be difficult , but maybe that 's what 's going on .
and so , there are different , but the beauty of this is , a hundred times a lot of energy , as a lot of energy , as a , and so , if you can deal with the problems , and the <unk> , the best thing , so the impact on the country and other things , almost in a chimpanzee .
so if does n't it , what ?
do we need to pull ourselves out to try and try to try to get out of it ?
bg : if you go into that situation , it 's like if you 've done a lot of time , and before you get a heart attack , what do you do ? you need a <unk> or something .
there 's a <unk> increase in the <unk> , which is linked to various techniques to protect the warming , so that we spend 20 or 30 years to protect us .
this is just a <unk> .
you know that we do n't need it .
some people say they 're not going to work on whether they 're not going to work together , because you think it 's going to be <unk> , because you know that a <unk> price will save .
i do n't know whether it 's smart , if you have the importance of this problem , but there 's a discourse in <unk> about what you want to do , if the things grow up , or that innovation has to be more than us .
rsw : have you , or two of these people want to convince you to offer ?
bg : well , unfortunately , life is the <unk> in many different .
the ones , the scientific dots , are very little .
do you tell you think it 's negative effects that do things exist ?
there 's very , very few things that you can tell you about who have a chance in a million .
and this is like this in the same as the adult .
you make the mistake now , and you make it much more .
and so , the idea is , today , if you 're all different types of problems , where you 've got to do , and that comes to the fact that the investment is not just the most part of the world , and in fact , the synapses is not necessarily the worst rule , and it 's okay .
the fact is that this goals should be .
but my dream here is that , if you can do it , you can do it , but it 's going to be carbon co2 , and i 'm so afraid that says , `` okay , it does n't work , but i 'm almost doing it , but i 'm gon na know it because it 's cheaper than the final method . ''
and this would be their answer to the challenges of synthesis , that when you do all of the time and energy around the co2 problem , all of the other goals of all of the other goals , in order to make the other dimension of carbon , all of the other goals of the toxins , the recreation of the brightness , the recreation of malaria , and so , that it 's a continuous basis of resources , money for us to help money , as it 's better .
bg : well , the real mile for us -- say , the u.s. should be 10 billion a year , and it 's not so unique .
in fact , they do n't want to suffer from other people .
you go to big <unk> , and there is a lot of people who have n't feel guilty , but that i 'm trying to do that .
it 's because it 's very short of the <unk> , and i 'm going to be able to do the knowledge . i think we should be more things that the potential have been very cheap .
if the <unk> you can get a very high school , you can only keep the rich .
i mean , every one of us here is going to be five times as much for our energy without change .
for the lower two billion , it 's a disaster .
and even <unk> .
his new <unk> is , `` why does n't do it with more people ? ''
he will still be because of his former histories , with the <unk> , but he realized that it 's a very small group , and therefore he 's going to be <unk> .
and this is a middle of me that i think for a second .
so the research , it 's just crazy how much it is .
bill , i think i 'm talking about almost today , when i say , i hope it 's good . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , here , ted , peter <unk> a <unk> called `` <unk> . ''
so the idea is pretty simple , <unk> , the highest <unk> structures with 20 <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> .
the bronx must be left .
and , again , it 's really hard because it 's trying to do it very quickly .
and so i thought that this is a interesting idea , and i built it in a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
since then , in fact , i 've spent about 70 <unk> across the world , with students , <unk> and architects , even with <unk> of the <unk> , and there 's something about the <unk> of collaboration , and i wanted to share some of them .
now , normally , most people tend to learn themselves from the task .
they 're talking about it , you think , how it looks like they 're going to do it .
then they get a little bit of time and a organization , and they are <unk> and supervise them .
they invest in a lot of their time in the 2020s .
and finally , before you have a lot of time , a lot of somebody makes him the russians , and they get a look at the top , you get a step back and `` <unk> '' -- you have your work .
but what 's going on , is that the `` 3s '' with a <unk> , because the weight of the chicken is going to do it .
there 's a lot of people who have a lot more than `` <unk> , '' and there are many <unk> .
they lie , they are willing , they are confused , and they 're really <unk> .
and of course , there are also a lot of a lot more than <unk> , and they have a lot more than <unk> , and they 've got the best <unk> of the <unk> .
and this is pretty amazing .
as a friend , you do n't just have the highest divide , but the most important structures of all .
what you want to ask , how does it mean ? why ? what is it ?
and peter said , `` no of the kids need to be in the government of the <unk> . ''
they do n't invest for <unk> .
but there 's another reason .
and that was <unk> that were forced to be able to find a real plan , ok .
and then it goes .
what happens when you saw the wheels on the top , you have no time and what ?
it 's a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
and what doesn’t work is , you know , is that you can start with the soviets and create prototypes , a lot of improvement , always with the doors to the bottom , so that they 're trying to create the opportunity to do .
now , these are the kinds of collaboration as a result of collaboration .
and with every attempt , the kids are taking care of what works and what do n't .
this is how we are working on working with a lot of work , more complicated -- but look at how different vehicles are .
the average rate of most of them is about <unk> , <unk> , who are more likely to do better , but not much , <unk> are better than the adults .
who is the last one ?
war and engineers , for happiness .
<unk> is the highest thing i 've seen .
and why is it ? because they 're trying to understand and measure mathematical patterns are the key to build additional structures .
we 're going to take a lot about three . but here 's interesting .
if you 're going to have a postcard , you 're going to be <unk> .
it 's amazing . they look like this team is going to win . ''
you can predict the question . why is this ?
because you have special skills of the <unk> .
they 're <unk> the process , they understand it .
and this team that makes it stable and on the work of physics , is changing the number
<unk> skills and <unk> of them .
if you have 10 , the typical one , you have about six , the mechanical structures .
i tried to be something .
i thought , let 's take the <unk> .
and so i rang a $ army for a team for a teacher .
what do you think about these gals ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . she had a team structure .
if somebody had a high place on the ground , it would have been the price of home .
so it 's not interesting that there 's a big impact ?
we <unk> this exercise with the same students .
so what do you think ?
now they understood the benefit of `` <unk> . ''
so that 's been in the same , as a team of a different from a best .
they get the highest on the whole time .
so there are a lot of lessons for us , from nature and success .
now , you may ask , why would you have to be able to create business policy ?
and the reason is , i use digital tools , understanding ways to help teachers and help devices .
and what the <unk> is doing is , they 're trying to show you to use these conversations .
in fact , every project has his own pearl earring .
the challenge is a common language , a common language .
and this is the value of this experience , and so simple .
and these are you who are interested in , <unk> .
it 's a blog , where you see how to take the surgery .
there 's a <unk> there .
you see some examples of all around the world , as people call the system and <unk> .
there are also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i believe that the one is actually becoming a <unk> conflict .
it tells us that all of our senses is to make us think about our feelings , how our feelings and our lives , in the challenge that we have .
and sometimes a small prototype of all this experience is everything we need to say , `` <unk> '' like `` <unk> . ''
and that can make a great difference .
thank you very much .
let 's take this machine .
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and that 's a time .
and everyone in this room has to go .
and you can go to the past , you can go into the future ; you can not be in here .
and i wonder what she would like , because i spent a lot of time talking about the day , i would often have this question , and they wanted everybody in the past .
i do n't know . she wanted to go back to the car before the cars were twitter or twitter or afghanistan .
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced you 're going to be a <unk> , which is decentralization .
and that 's what i understand .
i 'm not part of this group , i have to say .
i do n't want to stand in the past , and i 'm not because i 'm a conjurer .
it 's because it 's not to look at this planet , go to go .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the most fun time that it had ever been on the planet , not knowing what they want to do : health , wealth , mobility , <unk> .
there were never a time ago .
my bitches died every day .
my grandparents took these number two .
my parents are about 80 in the classrooms .
so it should be better than the beginning of my <unk> .
but it 's not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child , which is now in new delhi is just as long as the richest man in the world .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox was 100,000 dollars a million people on this planet .
they have the laws of the earth , in a sense , a bit of war .
they are gone . they are gone .
we 've got it <unk> . play-doh .
in the world world disease , the millions of us have just been one of the generation that we 've already done before .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
anybody else knows what ?
<unk> , modern medicine , our ability to stay billions of people , which are successes of science .
and from my view , the scientific method is trying to create things together , whether it works , if it works , if it does n't matter , one of the greatest achievements of humankind .
so that 's the good news .
unfortunately , this is the whole good news , because there 's a few other issues , and they are still mentioned .
and one of them is , despite all of our achievements , as a billion people on the world , every day , for every day .
this number goes down , and it goes very fast , and that 's false .
and not just that , we have our imagination to create this world .
cell phones , <unk> land , congo , oil , oil , oil -- they disappear , and if we do n't get out of the chaos , we would continue to do that mess .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it 's clear that we can eat food , the billions of millions of people , without the land that you live .
i think we can use this world with energy , but it 's not the same time .
i think that 's not .
but that 's what i 'm talking about at night -- one of the things that still give me at night -- we have scientific progress , and it 's never yet .
and we 've never been able to push it down , as we can do it .
and we are in the threshold , there 's amazing events in many places , and yet we really know that we have hundreds of thousands of years that we have to go back to a lot of time in the world that we have to go over here , we 've been able to figure out a time where we have progress on this kind of things that are more vulnerable than now .
the people can be understood in their opinion , and so they can not keep it .
not enough the truth will be free .
and listen , everyone has a right on his opinion , even a true on his opinion .
but you know , what are you right ?
you do n't have to look at your own facts . you ca n't .
and i started to have a while to understand this .
for about a decade ago , i got a paper article about `` the new york , '' a little article .
and i was amazed by creating resistance , and it 's too much on the bottom of the human rights in the history of humanity .
i did n't know what to do , so i just did what i 'm going to do , i wrote a paper ,
and soon after that , i wrote a paper about how much changed .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were mad .
so , i was a little bit like this article , and i did n't understand why the people thought that was based on a particular basis instead of finding out of nature .
but you know , i do what i do .
i mean , i 'm a journalist .
we 're going to get a lot of us , we go to eat .
but these articles made me , and i could n't figure out why .
and that 's because these <unk> , who did n't untie me at all .
these were <unk> people , thousands of people , <unk> people .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
and that continued to me .
but then i thought , you know what we were .
we are in a point where we do n't have the same relationship with progress .
we talk about it .
we 're going to talk about it , with little three-digit problem , `` progress . ''
okay , there 's some reasons , and i think we know what i do .
we have the trust in institutions , and even in the science of china , and there is no reason why this should not be .
you can just take a couple of name , and people can understand .
<unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , muslims , the year 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
so , there are questions and problems with people who have thought that they were always right ,
ask yourself , you ask you to find the evidence you want to ask you .
do n't do it .
but now , in fact , if you have to look at the evidence , you have to look at this image , and we are not good .
and i can tell you that we are in a epidemic of fear , as i never saw them and never .
about about 12 years ago , a story story has been a story story , a fantastic story , which is the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
very scary .
there were a study of studies that were happening .
within decades studies , it 's a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came out of the united states from england , from sweden , from canada , from canada , from canada , and they were all alike .
it does n't make a difference . it does n't make a difference , because we think what we believe in terms of what we believe what we do .
we do n't think about a few of you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , there 's a few
but you know what ?
the result of this was mad .
babri for the fact : the united states is one of the two countries on the world , the overproduction for herman .
this is a breakthrough , and we should be ashamed .
it 's gorgeous .
what 's happening we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
so , anybody else ?
is a single one in the audience ever want to die ?
it 's not very often .
in fact , in this country , not in the country , not in the country in the last year .
this is a lot of deaths from <unk> , 20 cents .
but because that 's not what 's going on here , we can hear it , and people like <unk> , and email from fear and <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> king lives .
and you can do it because they do n't get and adapt .
they do n't understand that these things seem to be exactly the same , but almost never .
and that 's something that we have to learn and very quickly .
this guy was a hero , <unk> .
he invites us from one of the worst nightmares of humanity .
no fear , no eyelashes , <unk> , wet .
the guy in the middle world .
he 's paul paul <unk> .
he has just been a few other people that you 've got a few other people .
he can save the lives of <unk> , more kids from the developing world .
all right , right ?
well , that 's good to say , paul <unk> and talk about <unk> , and says how dangerous you are , and that people are trying to stop .
and that 's what he looks like .
so it 's a graduate student .
now , paul paul in a public sphere , he ca n't buy any heartbeat .
he 's going to go to home , because people do love to tell you , where home kids go to school .
and why ?
i do n't need to say that , but communication are cultural .
take a look at the disease , ordinary diseases , and that 's right now .
we have now <unk> in this country .
and this is worse , and there 's pretty soon going to die again , because that 's just a question of numbers .
and they wo n't just stand up with meditation .
what is it ?
and i 'm going to highlight a few weeks ago , and i said , `` i think it 's a little bit <unk> .
no one ever did .
she would not lend her child .
<unk> .
why ? because we have a <unk> , and you know what ?
we had no written in this country at night .
today , i do n't know , if i 'm talking about somewhere in lagos in a plane , and in the age of the north , he 's about <unk> .
and in a few hours , he goes and <unk> a car , and it goes to long beach , and he 's going to take one of the <unk> <unk> today .
and he does n't know that he 's outlined with a <unk> disease , and we do n't know because it works the world .
this is the planet that we live . do n't do it .
we love to stop ourselves in afghanistan . we love that .
now , have you ever euthanize all of your staff ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , allowing them to do .
i know that they did that , because the half of americans have this day .
they take that stuff , and they look at the design , and it 's not a difference , as often as we 're talking to them .
the data shows all the time .
they get their <unk> . they do n't always forget .
that 's okay , you want to get 75 billion dollars for dark , same upside-down .
i read them .
it 's dark . dark .
why do we do ? why do we do it ?
well , i think we 're -- we hate the <unk> .
we hate a lot of government . we have no trust to the system .
and that 's not what our economy is .
it 's cruel to people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and <unk> ourselves to do it .
so where we are looking at , and where are we headed ?
we are in the poor of the <unk> .
this is great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , that 's really a serious story , because the stuff is needles , and we spend billions of dollars .
and i 've got all sorts of little shots .
none of them -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , so i do n't know what this is , but we spend billions of dollars for it .
and you know what ? if i say that , i 'm talking to people , and say , `` what do you do ? let 's do people like what you want .
they feel good . ''
and you know what ? you 've got wrong .
because i 'm not interested in whether it 's the <unk> , who says , `` hmm , i 'm going to use the message of the experts , but i 'm not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do the rest of the experts .
if you go to the bottom , where you do n't mind magic and imagination , or whatever you can not do science , and they will not be .
they go to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he showed us from the human genome , because he insisted that the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are more powerful than <unk> drugs that we know that they can learn the same for aids .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths in a country , as opposed to each other of these diseases .
do n't tell me that things are not religious consequences .
they have always . they have always .
well , the <unk> epidemic , where we are now in this is the <unk> fight between the <unk> <unk> and food chain .
this is a self-fulfilling debate . it has to stop .
it 's a debate about words , as happy .
that 's political , not science .
all of what we eat , every single <unk> , every <unk> , every year ,
you know , there was no <unk> in the garden .
there were no escape hatch .
we did n't have a street . we 've done everything .
we 've done it in the last 100,000 years .
and some of them , it does n't work .
we 've done what 's not happening .
now we can do it . and of course , there is risks . but , of course , it 's risks . but we can make something like any more in a life , and the stuff can help millions of millions of people .
do n't want to do it ?
i have to say i do n't understand .
we <unk> <unk> infrastructure food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i 'm always wrong is to do a lot of chemicals , pesticides , pesticides , <unk> , we do n't want to be a big natural gas with a thing that is wrong .
we do n't want our companies live .
we do n't want people to have babies .
and you know what my answer is all of that ?
yes , they have right . let 's do that .
it 's true , we have a huge <unk> , but that 's not science .
this has not done with science .
it 's right , morality , <unk> .
you know that science is not a company .
it 's not a country .
it 's not a idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes he works , and sometimes not , but the idea that we should n't do science with their work , because we 're afraid of course .
you know , in the next 50 years , we will have 70 percent more food than the moment .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
wow . fold .
they need that , and we do n't .
and why ? hoover changed food .
we do n't want to encourage people to use this <unk> information , like the <unk> .
<unk> is something which killed half a billion people .
it 's sort of an indication .
it 's just a ton of calories . it is resilient .
it does n't have any food ; it 's not a protein , and scientists do all of it in it .
and then people could be the food and they would n't be blind .
they would n't go extinct , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it would not be <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and everything that i 'm saying is , why are we going to say that ?
i mean , we ask myself , why do we care ?
because we do n't have any genes ?
it 's not about genes , it 's not about chemicals .
it 's not about our intellectual passion for machines , our legitimacy on higher food , healthy food .
it 's not about <unk> <unk> , it 's about people to live , and it 's about time to understand what it means .
because you know what ?
now , if we do n't do that , if we 're going to do as much as we 're going to do , i think , i 'm not going to be compassionate .
there 's no other description for what 's going on .
it 's selfish , it 's ugly , it 's ugly , and we have to do that .
so , that 's incredibly funny examples , you may say , `` would you want to go into this ridiculous movie and in the future ? ''
in any case . that 's what i want to do .
right now , you have in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can look at it for all of what we want .
we can put them where we want to take them up , and we 'll get them going to go to where we want .
we have to be able to use these conversations , and we need to think , but when we 're going to go into the way , we 're going to be able to be in the future , we 'll be able to do that .
i know that we can do , and because it is something that the world is now .
thank you .
thank you .
so , for some time , i 'm interested in the <unk> . it might seem like a magician to think about it , like , in a sense , it feels like me , or a deception that 's going to be a little bit about someone else 's someone .
in other words , <unk> , you have a <unk> effect , the <unk> , and that 's just because of the person , what 's going on your mind , is a <unk> or a kind of -- in the first place , there 's a <unk> or a kind of ...
a deception is going to be true , because someone knows .
and so we can understand each other , i think you can now show you a very , very simple inversion .
and i 'm going to show you how he works . this is a trick that 's at the beginning of any <unk> .
i learned him from the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> in the 1970s .
i 'm going to make it for you and you can tell you .
and then i 'm going to tell you why .
so , look what happens .
the knife that you can read ; my hand can read them .
i 'm going to keep the plank in my hand .
i 'm going to leave my <unk> .
and so you can do n't realize that in my inbox , you 're going to come up with him , i 'm going to do my wrist right now .
and so , you can see that there 's no way you can do anything else , and as long as i get <unk> , there is nothing in my sleeve .
and the goal is very simple .
i 'm going to play my hand , and hopefully , if all you are doing is my knife through my breath .
it 's actually so much on the place that i can buy .
there 's nothing in my trial or come from , and you do n't see , you see , you can see all of it .
<unk> !
well , this is a trick that i often often have kids kids to use , which is based on sound , because you can make a lot of deception , because it 's a very simple trick .
so , you know , a lot of you here in this room .
so it works .
i think the knife in my hand .
i 'm saying that i gave my wrist on , which is nothing to take me in my sleeve , or that 's a lie .
and the reason i 'm hearing behind you -- as the higgs boson , is that the actual secret of science .
in the moment , where i put my hand from you , you see it from the back , you know , where you were in a position where it was like .
amazing story ?
on the top of somebody in mind , somebody who 's not left .
so , he 's coming . exactly .
and when i <unk> me , that 's what i 'm going to do with them .
and now you can talk about why this is a success story , why do n't know that there is just three examples , because the mind and the way it 's information , because they do n't have to know , one , two , three , but it 's not a group .
but that 's not what i do n't do at all .
of course , it 's going to be able to do that , but through the <unk> of my body , with my heart , with my body , is now .
and when i take my hand up , the same thing i get <unk> , you get through this movement that comes back to me .
i 'll take this hand . and this is the frozen restaurant .
this is the trick that you can read your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what did that do with the <unk> ?
a year or so , i read a study that i really did .
i 'm not a doctor or <unk> , and so that 's what i was an amazing thing .
this is what happens when you imagine a white ball in the form of a <unk> , it 's just a slow , white face , which obeys a particular dimension .
but if you go to the shape , you get the <unk> , for example , in a smaller ball , and this blue is a <unk> , and it 's actually <unk> transparent .
and you know , even though they do n't have any programmers -- it 's just <unk> .
but a white pill is not so much like a blue wall .
what ? that 's what i did .
but it turns out that it 's not all .
now , if you take you , you are more likely to be treated as thick .
a traditional arm that 's at a end of yellow , and at the same red , it 's better than a white arm .
it 's also the <unk> objective .
a pill twice as much pills -- i 'm not able to remember the right statistics . sorry .
but the challenge is ...
now , the second brain play a role .
and the shape is a role .
and if you want to take the ultimate <unk> , you have to get a needle .
right ? a syringe with a revision , a few <unk> of a <unk> substance that you get in a patient .
this is a very strong image in the head . that 's very much more than a white wall .
this graph is really -- i 'm going to show you a different time when we have a <unk> .
so the fact that the white pill does n't look like the blue pill that does n't like this as a <unk> , not so bad .
and none of it has to do some research , it 's just our belief that we 're going to create a more difference .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magician .
i 'm going to do something that 's a deception , and you can look at it .
we know from this study that you have to get to the bottom , if it 's supposed to go .
this is a 18 inches long time , and it 's very , very <unk> , and i 'm going to get you a little bit like this .
this is really my meat . it 's not an effective amount of meat .
this is my skin . that 's not a <unk> .
so i 'm going to take this needle in my skin , and you get it down to the other side again .
now , if you were curious about -- if you knew it in sawdust -- i 've had the few people last week in the 1970s , and some of the people i did n't know , and in my wife , a woman had almost been <unk> .
so what i 'm going to do is you to imagine if you 're looking for the next 30 seconds , or you know what i 'm going to do in the edge .
you can see it as you can see , but you can also find out if you want .
so , it 's like this , where my flesh starts to the bottom part of my <unk> , i 'm just going to make a little <unk> .
i 'm sorry . do you hear that crazy ?
and now just a little bit of my skin and on the other side .
now we 've been in the same situation we 've been used for .
it 's about .
but now you can not understand my finger ?
so , i 'll show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people people think if you see it .
and you say , `` okay , that 's probably not so stupid and <unk> , you know , the skin is just for a few minutes . ''
now , i 'll show you .
how does this look like ? ok .
yeah , i know .
and people are saying , `` okay . i do n't see it right . ''
so people in the <unk> are going on .
so let me show you .
this is really my skin . that 's not a <unk> .
this is my meat , and i can do it .
sorry for me . if you like it , you look like you 're going to look .
the people in the morning , and the way that you 're going to look at the video games would say , `` well , this is pretty beautiful , but if it 's real , you know , this is a hole , and then it would be true , there 's a hole . ''
okay , let me play a little blood vessel .
yes , here it is .
now , i would like the needle to the needle .
i would take my arm , and you show you that there were no wires .
but i think in this painting , with the intention of a great deal , i 'm going to get the needle there and so forth .
we 'll take a few days in the next few days .
i hope you 've done it . thank you very much .
everybody 's talking about happiness .
i 've had a few people who had heard of the books of books in the last five years , and they 've gone to about 40 .
there 's a huge wave of knowledge for centuries .
there are very much <unk> .
everybody would want to make people better .
but despite all of these accidents of work , there are several generations that they do n't seem to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly by these cognitive clusters .
this is for <unk> , who are talking about their own happiness , and it 's for scientists to think about happiness , because it turns out that we do n't care about everyone else .
the first one of these <unk> is a <unk> technology .
it turns out that the word happiness is happiness is more complicated because we do it in many different things .
i think there is a sense that we can think about , but in the big , and that 's something that we have to be , and we are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to think about the well-being .
the second one is a <unk> of experience and memory : in fact , they are between happy in their lives and happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they are both <unk> in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and this is the radical fact that we can not think about the possibility of well-being , without making meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive proposition .
there is just no way to get it right .
now , i 'd like to talk to a example of someone who was wearing a fulbright that i had a story , and he was saying , he said , `` he said he would say a birthday , '' and he was absolutely beautiful music , and it was absolutely beautiful music .
and then he <unk> , and it 's really amazing , all the experience .
but that did n't .
what it was all the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of music music .
they did n't , because he was talking about a memory , the memory was the same , and the memory is all he had to win .
what we have to do is that we think about us , and about other people , if you can think about two things of itself .
there 's a <unk> self , who 's in the present and the present , the two , most of the past , but most importantly .
it 's the <unk> yourself , who 's a doctor , you know , when the doctor says , `` do n't i get you here ? ''
and then there 's a lot of self , and the <unk> self is , and the history of our life , and it 's the ones that the doctor is going to explode through the question .
or `` how did your trip ? '' or so on .
these are two very different planes , the <unk> themselves , and the two self , and the two is forced to the <unk> of happiness .
well , the <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and this starts really familiar with a fundamental reaction to our memory -- it starts immediately .
we do n't just tell stories if we tell ourselves about this .
so our memory tells us stories , which means what we should be talking about our knowledge is a story .
and let 's take a look at an example .
there 's another old study .
these are real patients that are scattered by a painful time .
and i 'm not going to play in detail . it 's not particularly painful , but it was painful because the trial in the 1990s .
they were asked to spend the eight seconds of her pain .
and here are two patients . these are their ] .
and they said , `` who are both less ? ''
and this is a very simple question .
google has been more likely to be done , and this time of death was longer , and every time of pain , the patient had a patient patient .
but now , there 's another question : `` how many times these guys that they were ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient had a lot of <unk> <unk> of the brain as a patient .
the stories of the <unk> were different , and because of a very important part of the story , how it was .
and no one of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this .
but one of them is quite worse than the others .
and the one that was worse than the pain was at the end of his nose . it 's a bad story .
how do we know ?
because we were asking these people who were asked , and how did it be the whole thing ?
and she was much worse for a while for a foot in nigeria .
well , this is a rare conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> itself .
so in fact , the <unk> self has been a lot of time .
now , what you could do a patient 's done , and we 've done clinical trials , and it was done , and it worked , you could actually be able to make the <unk> of the top of the group that you could do with the <unk> in a way that you could do it .
this is the case that the patient responds , but only a little bit , and it 's much less than before .
and if you have a few minutes , you realize that it 's time to be a little bit of time , and you 've got to say that it 's a lot of work , and now you 've got to have a better life on your experience .
what is a story about this ?
and this is for the stories that memory is happening , and it 's also for the stories we are .
so , a story is <unk> , of course , interesting moments ,
you 're very , very important , and this is the <unk> of the end .
well , the <unk> self has changed their lives .
it has just <unk> moments , a <unk> .
and you ask , what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're lost forever .
i mean , most of the life of our life -- and i 've been talking about -- you know , the psychological languages is about 25 million of them . in a month , there 's about 25,000 million of them do n't give you a little bit .
most of them will be completely influenced by itself .
and yet , you know , what you find is that you should be wondering what 's going to happen in this moments of the brain growth .
it 's the <unk> resource that we are in the world .
and as we decide if it would be really important , but that 's not the story that connects us to protect ourselves .
so we 've got the <unk> self and the <unk> themselves , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is time .
in fact , if you have a tour and the second week week , and the second week week is so good as the first time , it 's <unk> perpetual as much as the <unk> .
that does n't work for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself , there 's no <unk> grant from the <unk> , because there 's no new memory .
you have n't changed the story .
and in this way , the most important aspect , a <unk> self , and it 's a little bit of influence on this story .
now , the <unk> itself takes more than ted and learning stories .
it 's actually the future , because if you have a patient , we know two <unk> , and we should be told that he 's going to be , and that is the only thing that it 's supposed to be , and that 's the surgeon who will be .
the <unk> itself has no voice in this .
in fact , we do n't choose between memory , and we choose between ourselves .
and even when we think about the future , we think we do n't care about our future .
we think about our future , as a memory memory .
and in fact , you can see that , as you can think about it , as a <unk> of the <unk> , and you can think about the <unk> itself as a one , the way , the same self , even though , the ability to learn the <unk> self .
i have the impression that when we 're going to get rid of this , it 's very often the case , we 're going to get hurt in the fight for itself .
and that 's a little difficult to me , i think .
i mean , how do you know about our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that the problem itself has to be abolished .
and when i think about it , i think about a grant that we had a few years ago , where it was a lot of years ago , where i had ever done , and i think there were relatively <unk> on the relationship .
and i 'm probably talking about my memories , and i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had the dark pictures of the 600 pictures i had another .
now , these are three weeks , and that 's a few hours a couple of weeks .
there is a <unk> .
now , i want to be a little bit bigger , you know , in the way , i mean , in the way , you know , how do you get to the <unk> of memory , but even if you do it 's a real question . why do we have <unk> so much weight on the weight that you can do ?
so i want you to think about a thought .
so imagine your next meeting , you know that at the end of your shirt , all of these pictures are all the images , and they get a <unk> service that they do n't remember .
now , would you choose the same stick ?
and if you think about another person , there 's a conflict between your two types of self , and you have to think about how to do , and if you think about the answer , you know , if you have to think about it , you know , if you think in the sense of time , you can think a different answer .
what we 're talking about is that we have a problem that tells us with a choice between the two types of itself .
well , the two points of themselves are two people from happiness .
in fact , we have two concepts of happiness that we can use , a less self .
so you can ask : `` how can you be the <unk> ?
and then you would ask , how happy are the words in life ?
and they are all -- boring for example is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be used ?
and , by the way , we are just a good idea of happiness at the time .
if you ask for the happiness of the kindness of yourself , it 's a very different thing .
that 's not what it 's like a person .
it 's like , or whether the person is when the person is about life .
very different architecture .
everyone who has n't like to do that , because of the sake of happiness , and it 's part of a lot of researchers about well-being that can help me with the same time .
so the distinction between the happiness itself itself , and the kindness of the <unk> of it has been around in the last few years , and now you learn to create the forms of forest-making .
the <unk> organization had a global survey , and more than a half million people have been wondering about what they think about her life and talk about her experiences .
so in the last few years , we began to learn about the two points of self .
and the sum lesson we have , i think , is that they are really different .
you can know how to anyone with his life , and they do n't really tell a little bit about how happy he lives his life and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the blog that 's linked to you , it 's about <unk> .
what it means is that if you 'd like you , and you would tell you , oh , dad was a <unk> , how many would you think of yourself ?
well , you would know something about his size , but there 's a lot of uncertainty .
you have a lot of uncertainty .
now , if i tell you that someone is going to be in eight of a scale of 10 , you 've got a lot of uncertainty about how hard he is with your <unk> self .
so the injection is so much .
we know something about what the happiness is from .
we know that money is very important is goals .
we know that happiness is to be satisfied with people who we love to spend time with people that we like time .
there are other luck , but that 's kind of fun .
so , if you want to be the lucky of the two types of self , you want to do a lot of different things .
the implication of what i told us is that we should n't be able to be able to imagine as a win-win tool .
it 's a completely different idea .
well , a very short way that we 're not sure about happiness , we 're not going to think about life , and if we 're actually alive .
so if you ask the simple question , how hard people are in california , you will not be the right answer .
now , if you think about this question , you think that people are going to be happier when you say , in our lives .
and what 's happening when you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that 's why we 're in the climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the <unk> self , and it 's not even very important for the <unk> self , as happy people are .
now , because the <unk> itself is responsible for them , they can end -- a few people could come to school .
and it 's kind of interesting to what 's going on with people who are talking to california to be able to get happier .
now , you know , your <unk> self will be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to be , and you 'll think that you can be happier , because when you 're going to think about how much the weather is in the north , and they 'll feel that they have the right decision .
it 's very hard to think about well-being , and i hope you have a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you very much .
now , when we had a couple of weeks ago , and i 've been looking at it that there was a pretty interesting results that came out of that geyser survey .
is it something that you can get to do , because you have a few minutes ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most important thing we 've found in the <unk> survey is a number that we have absolutely not .
and we found that in terms of happiness .
if we started to think of what 's going to be <unk> to market .
and it turns out by a income of 300 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large decline of americans , about 300 dollars a year .
<unk> .
<unk> : 37 .
<unk> dollars in the year are the people themselves , and they are still more likely to be used .
so this is a very <unk> line .
i mean , i 've just seen three-dimensional lines .
what 's happening is that money does n't have a <unk> player , but that lack of money , and we can not have this adaptation very , very clear .
in the spirit of other people , the squad itself , you get another story .
the more money you have , the more you are .
that 's not true for emotions .
but danny , in the entire u.s. economy , there 's life , freedom to happiness .
now , if people would like to be serious , i mean , it seems to look at the head , all of what we believe in terms of interest and so forth .
is there a chance that politicians who is that the country is going to make a sense of how improbable ?
dk : you know , i believe that there is the role of the difference in politics .
it 's going to be changed in the united states , no question , but in the united states , it 's going on and in other countries .
so people are saying that they should be happy to believe if you think about politics .
it 's going to be a long time , and the people are going to be able to identify or whether they want to explore , or whether they want to find out of this discussion .
how do you feel hard to think about how you think , or whether you think about yourself , or whether you can think about it .
this is what makes us change , i think , in the past years .
in the united states , you 're looking for the <unk> of the population .
this is , i think , in the next one or two decades .
well , it seems to me , i 'm going to be the subject , or should still be the most important political debate for the next few years .
thank you for the invention of economics .
thank you , scott <unk> .
i 'm morgan cola . i play video games .
i 'm going to talk about 10 years today , and my goal for the next decade is to make it so much to understand the world in reality .
i have a plan for that . i want to convince more people , including them to work more and more and more games .
in fact , we spend three billion hours per week .
some of you may think , `` this is a whole lot of time for games . ''
maybe a lot of time , if you think about how many problems we need to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research on the center of the future is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours per week is not enough enough to solve the same problems of the world .
in fact , i 'm convinced that when we want to survive the next century , we should have access to have this time .
i 've been using sure that the less time of 21 billion hours per week .
this seems to be a little bit easier , so i 'm trying to do it , if we can solve problems , if we have problems like hunger , poverty , global warming and obesity , i think we need to help , games to work together for the last mile hours .
no , i do n't know .
why ? because of this picture , i think that 's what i think is pretty much , i believe that games are so important for all the human species in the future .
this is a regular set of photographers 's <unk> .
he was trying to play the emotions in the games , so he was able to get the camera a camera .
this is one of the classic language of play .
if you 're not a player , you may have some protocells of the ladder in this picture .
they just look at this sense of urgency , a lot of fear , but also , people are really focused on the verge of a real difficult problem .
now , if you go to see , you see a lot of <unk> here , looking at some <unk> , and the mouth are a sign of shame .
this is a player who 's on the edge of a call .
oh , you know , okay . so , ok . so , you have a player here .
a pakistani victory is a result that 's so much positive that they did n't know that it was possible .
it was pretty close to the imagination .
and if you have it , you know , you 're actually able to be able to be able to do it .
this player is short of a <unk> victory .
and this is what we have to look at 65 million simultaneous <unk> on all the world , if we look at the <unk> of the next century , the face of the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we see in the face of the face in the real life when we look at other problems .
i read it as `` i live ? '' and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes .
that 's me , as i 'm going to live , i 'm sorry .
this is a <unk> in my hometown home in my hometown of california , california , where i was working on play in the <unk> , as i am in the real life .
this is a problem that has a lot of gamers .
we think we are not so good in games .
and i do n't just have less successful , although that 's what it is .
we 're going to work in <unk> . i mean myself in the context with how to make something wrong , especially to collaboration .
so when we are in a <unk> , i think many of us are able to solve the best version , and then they are <unk> , to solve the problem , as long as we decided to solve it .
and in reality , if we eat , if we eat , we feel often differently .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel <unk> ; we feel <unk> , even depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
we do n't feel like that , if you play games , you 're gon na play it .
and that 's what i wanted to do with a paraglider .
why is it possible in games , and you can not just do anything ?
how can we create these emotions to the reality ?
so i started games to find the world of warcraft , which is the ideal of the <unk> environment .
and i have a lot of things that i 'm proposing can make sure .
so , first , if you 're sitting in one of those angles , especially in the world of warcraft , there 's a lot of different characters that are willing to show you a <unk> mission .
but not only a mission , but a mission , the perfect to the perfect level in the game , right ?
so you can do that .
you have to have a task you can not solve .
but always on the edge of their skills , so they 're going to say , but there 's no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you do n't get around , and you 're <unk> . there are always about a big deal .
and there are fewer employees .
where they go to hundreds of thousands of people who are working with them to build their glass mission .
we have n't been able to do that in the real life that we have n't really , that feeling that we have to stop .
and also , there 's this epic story , and we 've got this ted story about why we are here and what we do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
you 've heard about `` lean '' and `` scared '' or `` <unk> intelligence . ''
there 's no feedback of life .
now , if i 'm going to do this stage , i do n't know , t , and i do n't want to say , you do n't want to be <unk> .
i 'm not living in the real life .
so , the problem of the <unk> of the world 's <unk> is that it 's so consistent with the edge of a <unk> <unk> that we 're trying to take our whole time in these <unk> .
they 're just better than the reality .
so , despite today , all the world of <unk> pollutants have moved million million years ago , the virtual problems of dystonia .
it 's not necessarily a bad bad .
it sounds bad .
but to see it in the context , <unk> million million years ago , our first <unk> <unk> .
so the first <unk> model .
ok , so , when we talk about how much time we are working with games , is that , as you know , when you get the time in the kind of human evolution , you know .
but also , as well , because it turns out that we are using these whole time , we can use what we 're going to be as humans .
we are endangering ourselves to do things .
this is the truth . that 's what i believe .
if you look at this interesting statistic , this recently inspired by the u.s. bank university : the average young man , from today , in the average young man , 10,000 hours of <unk> , for the 21st century .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number .
first time for kids in the united states , you know , the <unk> <unk> , who you spend in school , until the age of a high school -- if you never .
so we have a whole bunch of urban <unk> , on the young people , which is how to be a good player , like all other things about them .
and maybe some of you have the new book of la <unk> , `` <unk> . ''
so you see his theory of success , the theory of success of 10,000 hours .
it 's based on the great research of the <unk> , which is that when we spend 10,000 hours , we spend a little bit higher to the 21st .
we 're going to do it in the world , as we 're going to do , as the most important people in the world .
so what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , `` what 's the player 's good ? ''
because if we could figure out , we would never have to think about the human human lifespan .
so many people we have in the world that we 've been working on for the hour that we 've been working on <unk> .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people who are wonderful .
and in the next decade , we have a hundred billion players that are really good to us .
if you ca n't hear it .
and the <unk> communities that make energy energy , and on their work , rather than <unk> in the world , particularly in india , china , sub-saharan africa .
you expect a hundred billion player in the next decade .
that 's why we have 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what it is to make us play games .
here are the four things i 've been -- as first , of course .
ok , imagine that the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to be wrong to make a cause , and so with us , believe that we have a <unk> hope .
scientists think that it 's a little bit of purpose that it 's possible , and that it 's always about to be able to try it .
they wo n't travel around .
scientists are masters of these <unk> social disparities .
there 's a lot more interesting species that show us that we 've been able to tell people that we 've been able to show with you , when they heard us .
and the reason for this is that it requires a lot of trust to play a game .
we 're waiting for someone to imagine that the rules that we have the same goal , and to kill it .
so this is how the outlets are used by <unk> , trust .
so , as a result of work , we are more social relationships .
<unk> security . fantastic .
you know , there 's a reason why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours per week , for example .
and the reason is that when we play , we 're actually going to work hard , we 're going to work hard , when we hate milo or anything .
we know that when human beings do work when we 're lucky , wonderful work .
and investors are always willing to work when they get the right thing .
and finally , memetics .
scientists love to be part of the <unk> of the <unk> .
here 's a <unk> that 's looking at the right light , showing you all the wikipedia , the largest <unk> of the world .
the second largest <unk> of the world , again , almost almost <unk> of the world of warcraft .
five million people die of every month .
they have more information about world of warcraft in the internet as a different subject in every other scales of the world .
they create a epic story .
it creates an axle of a matter of knowledge about the world of stomatopods .
ok , so these are four people who are used to be a single outcome . scientists are <unk> , laws .
these are people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is that they believe they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real world .
this is the problem i 'm trying to solve .
david <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is great . he 's talking about how people spend so much time , energy and money .
and he says , `` we 're going to do n't have less than a <unk> in virtual worlds . ''
and that 's from an economist . and it 's logical .
and he says ...
not like me -- i 'm games , i 'm a little bit more .
so he says that this is actually going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to live in the same way .
you can be able to play social bonds with other than the real life . you get more complicated and happier in the same life .
so , he says it 's totally <unk> , the only more people in the virtual world as well .
i love to do that .
but it 's not a <unk> .
we need to start to make the real world in a game .
my self comes from a event , which is only two years ago .
there are these <unk> wear , <unk> . you know ?
now , there were a fantastic <unk> ,
and these were the first of people who were used to be <unk> .
and if you 're talking to the ancient greek <unk> , you may know that story . the story about how it 's like .
<unk> <unk> , games , sort of <unk> , where they were able to be able to be able to be launched during a row .
and then , when there was a great famine , the king of the <unk> , a <unk> idea .
people were dying . people hate .
it was an extraordinary situation . we needed a huge solution .
so they decided to be <unk> , the <unk> and put a national strategy . the next day you would play .
and they would be very interested in the <unk> , and games are so fascinating , and we were able to <unk> the radiation that they never forget that there were nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat .
and as <unk> <unk> , they were so 18 years old , so they went back to a day , and the next one .
the same thing , i think , let 's play now .
we 're going to play games for the real world .
we 're going to play games to make sure that in the real world , all of the real life is not curious about how we need to play .
but it does n't have to be the end .
this is the beauty .
for <unk> years , it was not better , so did the king , the last <unk> .
they put this out in two <unk> .
they played a <unk> , and the wright needed to have a <unk> adventure .
they <unk> <unk> , and they went on a new home , and they had so many people back to their lives and start with the rest of a neighborhood where they were able to survive .
this sounds crazy , right ?
but the <unk> <unk> shows that the <unk> , which later , the <unk> , the same dna like the old <unk> .
and so scientists , at the beginning of the buddha , the <unk> of the word was really honest .
and in fact , evidence of evidence , the evidence of a global field , which is almost 20 years to do what was expected .
so this may be the crazy story .
now , you 've actually had her own people who were going to play 18 years old , and then they had done lots of them , and so many of the things that have found it on the entire civilization .
so , we can .
we 're going to be <unk> .
this was the first <unk> in real world of the 20th century . it was 16 years ago .
it took 18 years old , we play for 18 years .
i think we 're willing to play for our own <unk> .
so they sent half of her civilization on a new world , so i 'm going to spend my 21st century .
we should be anxious that half of us have a week a day with the world , we have learned the problem of the real world .
so , i know you 're going to say , `` how do we solve problems of the real world in games ? '' and one of the things i 've got to do in my last few years of the institute for the future .
we have in the banner in our office in palo alto , in order to tell the future .
we do n't want to try to say the future .
what we want to do is the future .
we want to look at the best possible , and then people want to come up with this idea in reality .
we allow ourselves in buddhism .
so i 'm going to show you a couple of three games that i 've developed , to try to make people grapple in their own future .
this is `` world without oil . ''
the game is from 2007 .
it 's a <unk> increase in which you have to have an <unk> .
the <unk> rule is invented , but we have a lot of <unk> , so it 's going to be a lot better , and they have to figure out how to get their real life if it 's true , and you have to figure out how to make your life , if it 's true , and we have to figure out how to do it .
we 've done this game with <unk> players in 2007 . and we 've done it over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it 's a <unk> experience .
nobody wants to change the lives , because it 's good for the environment , or because we should .
but if you were in an <unk> , and we 're going to say , `` stop . ''
this is a fascinating adventure , which is what you 're looking for .
so , imagine what they used to be , and most of our principles have been able to play the game .
so we have a look at the next olympics , we have a bigger problem , and the only way it 's just like .
we have the game called the <unk> of the center for the future .
so , if you think of yourself , you know , the fact that people have only been 23 years on the planet .
this kogi is called global <unk> <unk> .
it 's called the claim to convince them , we have almost like a `` <unk> '' <unk> .
you know , <unk> <unk> , where it 's called `` <unk> , '' and you have the <unk> , the scientists , the <unk> , and you can support them .
but in our game , instead of only five people , we say , every one in the <unk> , and it 's our problem , the future for energy , food , health and the future of social justice .
four player took a game eight weeks .
and they found thousands of creative creative that they can read when they were <unk> .
and the last game we 've got to the three . it 's a game in collaboration with the world trade .
if you go to the game , they get from the world bank , `` social <unk> , '' by 2010 .
we work with universities in africa , and we have to create social companies .
we have a paper program , and we have <unk> , because we have <unk> , to design , sustainability , vision and healthy .
i want to share them all the game with young people , all around the world , especially in <unk> , who are living in their own social society .
i 'm going to finish .
i want to ask you .
what do you think ?
we have all this fantastic player , we have a bunch of things we have to do , but we have the real world .
now , i hope that you have to say that perhaps human resources are who we can do for work in real real life , and that games have a great meaning for change .
we have this whole transformation , <unk> productivity , the ability to use social nets , and the desire to <unk> meaning .
now , i hope that we 're using games games play together for the planet to survive .
and i hope you 're going to play with these play games .
so if i 'm going to be able to be in the next decade , i 'm now using two things : that we can build each other future , and that we can learn all sorts of games .
so i say , let 's say the <unk> games go .
thank you .
i 'd like to tell you a little kid at a couple of months ago , a brahmin for <unk> .
i was going to write my <unk> , but i was told with the <unk> of the <unk> , and i realized that i was never in my life , which is what the word `` <unk> . ''
i read them .
`` upwake '' , <unk> , `` <unk> , water , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , rca , rca ,
<unk> : healthy , more , <unk> .
i gave this list of a friend , and i had to find , and she was able to read it , and i was only until `` <unk> , '' and he would have to come back to me , and he had to say to me , and he was trying to read and find out to me , and he was trying to read and <unk> me to the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
of course , this was a <unk> , child <unk> . i was just thinking that the copy of this was pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early '80s when i was working with the university , and so i started to see my approach outside of my own forests , both in other kids and the world around me .
and god 's done , i did n't have any <unk> .
if i 'm going to take this talk , i would have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get some of the person who would be like a person who would like to be able to take their lives in <unk> solutions , and today , i 'm going to have a lot of opportunities and hope that i had .
so i immediately immediately <unk> the hurtigruten of 2009 , and i realized that i think there 's a continuous decline .
here 's the <unk> version of this <unk> .
it 's not a lot better .
in fact , the last two words is `` <unk> '' and `` healthy . ''
but it 's not just words .
it 's about what we think about people think about these words .
it 's about recognizing the inside of the words , and how we use these values .
our language shows our thinking and how we see the world and our people .
a lot of <unk> societies , including the greeks and the secret , really , that you can be a big force , because that 's what you feel like nonstop .
so what do we want to do -- is a <unk> people or a great people ?
in fact , a lot of people as a kid , as a child , no one , they <unk> and <unk> them .
would n't it be able to get them back ?
a man who drove me up to my boss was my shirt at the <unk> . everest , in the <unk> of <unk> .
he 's called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , as you can think , americans do n't want to name themselves , so he 's been called dr. sam .
and dr. robinson has been very <unk> , and he was working for the work with kids .
i found the time i 've been in this hospital , just <unk> -- until my <unk> .
i 've got to get rid of all the cds , and i 'm going to do with this cacophony , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- that you 've been able to get my <unk> . and i 've eaten them . i did it .
and imagine , i 've ever been as a young child with dr. animation , and so trying to stop this ties , <unk> without success .
and one day , he gave me to my hands -- these techniques are just <unk> and courage -- and he said to me , `` wow , <unk> and young girl , you will be one day of one of my <unk> .
and if you 're doing it , i 'll give you a doctor .
now , of course , this is just a simple trick of dr. animation , so i was able to make the exercises i do n't want to do , with the fact that the ceo of <unk> was in the middle of the second car , but he was actually able to get my daily <unk> with the eyes .
and i think today about how much his vision of my language , and i was able to imagine myself as an art of creativity , great and more man .
this is just one example of many , as adults in the familiarity of a child .
but as you know , as you know , like the <unk> of our knowledge , we do n't have a building , if you do n't have a building , you know , if we all know , it 's all possible to help yourself even as much people .
our language shows the social changes , which has been done in many technologies .
from the medical talk of view , you can tell me that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> from the body of people who are going to protect all the risks , so you can achieve all the way that you can achieve all of these challenges , and not to talk to the <unk> of the world , but you can achieve all the way to use your own identity , and then with all of the world of developing countries , you can achieve all the way that you can achieve yourself .
now , in fact , the technological changes in the technological changes in the world , the one that has been a different truth , which is that every single person could be a lot of <unk> and very good , and the human ability to be our biggest .
the human ability to empathize -- that 's a interesting story , because people have taught me to tell me how i 'm going to talk to me , and i 'm always going to ask myself .
so this sentence from ottawa , with the idea of success , or the idea of being able to use a challenge , or not to be able to create a challenge , or not to be able to create a challenge , or not to help me with my disability .
but the truth is that we change . of course , we are homo duplex , not whether it 's physical , emotional or even change .
and i think that 's good .
we ca n't make sure that we have to be able to do with our lives better .
both are just working on our lives .
and i see myself as my footage .
sometimes i remember that it 's very happy , sometimes it 's not easy to see , but he 's all over me .
and i 'm not going to use the impact , and i want to take the impact of a human being .
there are plenty of lives in life , and we 're just <unk> real , and they have only real real life , and every person will be different from whether or not to say , but as we can .
so we 're not just responsible for the people that we love to be <unk> , but they also want to learn it .
and we do n't have to help our kids , if we have to feel that they can not access .
you 've got to do two things : to be the medical issue , and you want to be the medical idea about whether i 'm a <unk> .
and to be honest , the only truth and valleys of whom i 've taught me today is that the world is always being able to tell you with this speech .
in our desire to protect people who are supposed to be on the heart , and you have a tendency to know the cause of the truth , or the reason that we need to be a tendency to prevent them , and we have a tendency to quality of the quality of the people who are expected , in fact , that we do n't have the immunity that someone is actually more effective .
now , this is the idea of the idea that only has human rights , which is , in the middle , and how we 're going to use , for every single one , for example , for every single one of the other .
if we do n't want to be able to suffer from people , and not all of our forces , and we can go to the natural struggle that you might have to live , another more disease .
we <unk> a people who has a value for our society .
so we have to look at the <unk> , and look at all of the human possibilities .
but in particular , it 's between the perception of our <unk> and our great economy .
we should n't tolerate this very early detection , or if we 're not trying to avoid them , we should be able to prevent them under the carpet , but it 's about to <unk> it in the wild .
i 'm going to be more interested in order to be sure that we do n't need to be focused on it , but that we have to be able to give them a chance to give you a <unk> , and maybe even to help .
and maybe we can make it as well as a natural <unk> , secure and useful , and feel that through their presence , it is n't more effective .
in this year , 20 years of charles darwin , and when it 's about 150 years , we have heard of evolution in evolution in evolution , and i think , in something very interesting in human spirit .
i would like it , not the most of his work , and not not the <unk> of his kind of ideas , but the way that affect the best .
there 's gdp of creativity .
not only from the work that we 're talking about is that the ability of the people , to survive and <unk> , from the human mind , is not connected to conflict .
so , again , change and self-confidence , the great skills of humans .
and maybe we know , because of course , we are stuck when we 're really <unk> .
maybe it 's the sense of al-qaeda , a sense of the metabolism , a sense of our own power .
we can do something about it .
we can put together a new meaning that 's about severe early .
maybe we can be able to see them .
and consequently , for a change where we do n't have to solve .
i think the biggest power that we have to be ourselves , is that we should be normal .
well , who 's normal -- who 's normal ?
there is no normal .
there 's the usual . the whole model . but they do n't want to be the normal . they would like to learn that there 's really possible to know if it really matters ?
i think about it .
it would be great if we 're talking about this paradigm of conscience , and whether it 's still a little bit cheaper , we can achieve the forces of a lot of kids , and they can help them , and they can help them , and they can help them , to get their very important and useful skills .
in fact , we figured out that we had people from the generation of our society , useful to be useful and useful .
well , there 's evidence that the <unk> began about 60,000 years ago years ago , and people were <unk> <unk> , and they may be able to understand the psychological health care of these people .
they do n't have these people as a <unk> and worried about it as well as well .
a few years ago , i was in the town that i grew up in a <unk> in the <unk> lake in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i stood in a <unk> tongue .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i feel like a guy behind me , `` well , that 's not <unk> . ''
and i read it , and i found this old man . i did n't know who he is .
and i said , `` sam , sir , you know ? i ca n't remember . ''
and he said , `` well , they did n't tell me .
when i first saw her first , i was reading her from her mother .
oh , um .
and of course it did it .
this was dr. <unk> , a man , which i knew about my mom on this day , because i was , in fact , a <unk> two weeks ago .
the doctor for <unk> psychiatry was my mother in the evening , and so my mother had the man who i 've been working on to the world ,
and because i was born , and my feet went to you , and i just had to give me a few notes about this , and i had a blog for me , and i had some laptops on this , and i had a blog for me , and a few notes on the other foot was the bad news .
and he said to me , `` i had to tell your parents that you never have to be able to do , and never would be like his kids or anything that you could never be able to make a collaborative life , and since then , you know , i 'm just not afraid . ''
the amazing thing i found was that he was <unk> on my entire childhood life , i did n't know if i was working on a <unk> in the second class , if i was in the <unk> of the year , i would like to <unk> my loan to <unk> his students , <unk> from the <unk> of my school district and the <unk> of california .
and he called this part of his <unk> of the <unk> , the potential of human .
you can not just be enough for how important this is for the quality of the people .
and dr. <unk> told me , he said , `` i 've realized that kids , if they do n't have any other day , and if you only have a little more , if you get kids , you have a lot of work . ''
you can see dr. dr. <unk> .
he was understood that the medical diagnosis , and as someone led to be two different things .
and also , i 've been my time in the course of time when they were asked myself in my age of 15 years , if i was able to ask me , i decided that if i had a lot of meat and the readers , i would not have a second .
i wanted to be normal .
if you ask me today , i 'm not sure .
and that 's happening because i have a chance with my legs , and i still have all of my experiences .
and maybe this change was possible , because i had a lot of people , and i had a lot of people who came up with me , instead of people who would help me or write a vision of music .
look at it , you just have to just have some people who can tell you how they can adjust their forces , and they are .
if you can convince it , your own life is going to solve the forces , the human spirit is so <unk> -- if you can use that , and for someone in a sense of a moment , the door , you have a very good teacher .
they take them to come back to the doors .
the real importance of the word `` <unk> '' is `` <unk> . ''
it means something that means is to be able to have a sense of urgency .
so , what is the potential for us ?
in the 1960s , in 2004 , in the u.k. , <unk> <unk> .
you call it `` <unk> <unk> '' in the u.s. , we call it as `` <unk> . ''
the students are trying to make toast .
and the better students are <unk> <unk> , provide the better teacher and freedom .
they 've been talking about a <unk> period of students , and they had no good , and she was told you , they were very smart , and after those three months , they were really <unk> .
and of course , there 's a <unk> of the heart that the patient was going to be <unk> , they 're just enough .
and the same time it was after the three months .
but only that , still has been in school -- except for the students that have the school .
and what 's interesting about this trial was that the teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers did n't understand that something changed .
now , they were told that , the company and who are capable of the students with the magic . and so they just give them a little bit about it .
so the only part of a nuclear system is a pencil , a broken , a lot of opportunity , and it does n't have any hope .
now , if we can design it to the human mind , to help ourselves , and other people to learn all good , curious and <unk> , and then we get our forces .
now , if you think about a spirit of this behavior , we can create a new reality and new .
i want to end up with a poem that 's written by a sierra poet called <unk> , and the poem i 've heard about my friend chris <unk> , and the poem is `` the god , the only of the christ , not the god of the name , not the god of the name , not the god of the name , but the god of the christ , not only the god of the name , but the god , the only of the christ , not the god of the name , but the god , the only of the christ , not the god of the name , but the god of the christ , not only the god of the name , but the god of the christ , not only the god of the name , but the god of the christ , not only the god of the name , but the god of the christ , not only the god of the name , but the god of the christ , not only the god of the name , but the god ,
come on , dance , thank you .
