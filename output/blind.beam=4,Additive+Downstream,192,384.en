yes , good afternoon ladies , gentlemen .
all of you thank you very much to talk to you today .
and i have to think of myself now .
my name is christian <unk> , and i 'm strange , <unk> <unk> at the town .
that 's what 's called <unk> for eight years .
and my favorite statistic is : first of a second organization , the third thing is the public order .
so i 'm responsible for the ministry of this city .
and yeah , you do n't force .
i know .
and beyond that , and that 's something which my son , particularly , i 'm also <unk> .
i mean , that 's what i 'm reading the head department department .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and i think , of course , i think , of course , a theme of what i want to talk about .
that 's the theme of the <unk> , because it 's also beginning to fire .
we hope to the best , and we 're going to do the worst of the worst , that 's what we said .
you know it .
he used to be general <unk> .
and then i do n't start something quite interesting .
and i 'll give you a better job .
this is what we 're talking about when there is a risk that we 're going to stand with a disaster , for example , <unk> .
a lot of people are gone on .
it 's empathy , it <unk> .
and somewhere on the edge , a suitcase , lonely , left , something <unk> , maybe <unk> .
no one seems to belong .
the suitcase is no .
and suddenly a <unk> .
let 's leave the <unk> .
police : <unk> , <unk> .
people are calling .
<unk> <unk> .
go out .
what 's going on ?
we do n't know that or we ca n't say .
people leave the building .
children cry .
some of you might even have to go to it because it needs to go .
all of a step .
there 's <unk> there .
panic made .
i 'm hearing now .
the rest of the rest of the rest of your imagination .
but it 's not a fantasy that i have <unk> .
that 's exactly what happens in this week .
there 's one such woman .
after a sudden , it turns out that only , in <unk> , nine kilogram drugs were there .
but the people were exactly that , and so a friend told me this , from the building .
it was n't anything .
and it came to the fact at least in the group of the group that my friend was in my friend .
and god is n't panic , otherwise it 's not rocket as true as it seems .
you can see , in a <unk> disaster , in a <unk> , you know , you have a very important thing .
communication is therefore important because the people in this situation is being used to interspecies communication .
you want to know what 's going on .
in the old days , in the old days , that was quite easy for the authorities .
we just have n't said or we lied .
why ?
because the so-called <unk> impact .
you have to say , `` god , people get into panic , '' there is n't the truth , or we do the <unk> .
this is in a period of social media , in a period of twitter , in a period of facebook , in a period of private and public <unk> , in a period of <unk> and public television , in a time of <unk> and public tv .
so , simple and so , you know , it 's not a morally morally morally thing , and the second thing we 're seeing is the last thing we report about the event .
you may remember the world hall a few years ago .
the first one message came from twitter .
from someone who was on a conservation , and it 's very palpable and immediately , there 's a plane and we save the people now .
that was n't <unk> .
and you can see , we rely on , today , and now , of course , the truth and say the truth to be very <unk> .
because mostly of course , we 're also the last last thing that we know , because we have to look at it , of course , that we 're just <unk> information .
it 's the media media , or the private revolution , or they do n't do it .
so , of course , we 're going to eat in food , and that 's something that we 've gone from the media , we think of the future we 're going to use .
and we 're going to get the good old <unk> again .
however , just as a form of <unk> .
this is what we 're going to do in the next few years , in the next few years , we 're going to build about a hundred of you who do n't know that , when it comes to the <unk> .
in the old days .
you might know what the three times you 're going to do is even a little bit of time , even once .
i do n't know anymore .
we 're going to do this today today with all of the things that we have in this place , so <unk> , about facebook , about twitter , about the radio dial at night , over the tv and at the end of the internet and the local media and so forth , of course , of course , of course , of course , to continue the data further .
and we know , we have to be there very quickly , and we have to design it very quickly and <unk> , because the dying and citizens will go .
and ultimately , we do n't know what we want to say .
communication in the crisis , or in the disaster , there 's a question of <unk> over all media who are available to , and it 's a question of <unk> .
now , it 's our biggest problem , because the <unk> and citizens are going to say , well , you know , it 's not , or they say , it 's much worse than it is .
so , we 've done some good experiences with facebook and twitter , even recently .
and you may have a few of them in the media .
we 've had a bigger <unk> in food .
and it 's a so-called chemical phone .
these are bombs who are equipped with a <unk> corridor , because they should n't put the houses on the second world war , and only the ground in the second world war in world war in world war , and only the ground in the second world war , and they came up with explosion .
the problem is just a lot of those bombs never worked in front of those bombs , and they 're in the recovery of other things .
and that 's where we have been saying by an elderly gentleman who 's the conscience that said that he wanted to go back to the minister , we were now , he 'd seen <unk> <unk> , and now he showed the authorities that 's a bomb .
by the way , several old ladies came all over the <unk> .
we 're going to see what we can find .
these bombs have got to be immediately in place , not <unk> , they 're burning .
and so we kind of put it in the <unk> park , and it turns out , in a sense of a word , a bomb let a <unk> .
and in the history of the city , the whole communication talk about facebook and twitter , and twitter , all over the ages of the city , far across the world ,
and the media was excited . it 's in the background .
we did n't even have to do with them , but they have <unk> and <unk> , everything about mysticism and twitter .
all of this had a great effect for us , because the <unk> will become clear over these social media .
just so , you have to give me a sign if i 'm supposed to stop .
i ca n't look at this in the clock .
that 's the distribution of that , because first of these social media have the advantage that they 're very sharing .
not so much <unk> , because the members are tweeting there , or the <unk> , as you call them .
secondly , early illustrations .
if anything is n't true , you write something so the <unk> that i 've talked about , you know , that 's the entire community in the state of the <unk> .
and it 's a very high lot of that , so if something is wrong , then it can be going to be going to get it very quickly .
and we have a huge <unk> .
i said yes , <unk> , who found the exciting thing , like a bombshell in the <unk> park .
so , we 've been looking for all the things that are happening in the last few years , and there 's a lot more than the <unk> of one of the people think of one .
again , the city can now eat from such a <unk> home .
a bomb that has to be able to get into a park , certainly not one such .
but it can also be found , and also afterward , we just found it in the <unk> , and then we 're going to get there with your <unk> and try to do that in seven feet .
and when they 're going to think about , think of the other cities , if they 're going to be able to get it , because they have a so-called <unk> , which you ca n't help you , and you know , we 're going to have a variety of houses that they 're not going to look like before .
and this is important to communicate , on the other hand , on one of the world is necessary , is necessary to make communication speed , is necessary to make communications , to make you panic , to make sure that the people are capable of making this difficult situation .
and social media also helps us to be allowed , because ultimately they 're all involved in communication , and it 's not just a <unk> combination , as we 're in the <unk> , <unk> , and certainly in the ecstasy of the big bang .
so today , today 's not just a mission of the federal government , not just a mission of the hospital or the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> cross , but communication in the library and a disaster is all about us .
and <unk> it has shown .
it 's about twitter , and over facebook , you know , the aid of the aid , when there 's a lot of the help , and you did n't know at all where they are .
this shows , there 's a lot to do for public communication in the <unk> , but it 's an unprecedented improvement with the <unk> and the <unk> , which is the social media coming out of a <unk> , from a non-zero-sum even no way to think more .
and i 'm hoping that i 'm convinced a little bit of this medium that this medium that 's actually used for the good things of life , even in <unk> its sense and purpose , and that we 're going to have to be used as a city , which is to be used to the <unk> of life , and the citizens and the present , and i end up and i end up at the end of my time , and i end up with me now , and i end up at the end of my time , and i end it all of my time when i did the whole time .
thank you .
so , a beautiful good evening .
i 'm <unk> .
i 'm a writer , and i <unk> , as you 've just heard .
and i 'm now now here to be a personal <unk> .
what it is , i 'm going to make it harder , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i 'm going
before i do this , i have to make some things .
the first is , i think we need stories to live .
we ca n't live without stories .
and i think , i think , there 's a lot more <unk> , <unk> , <unk> stories , as a result of entertainment is being produced .
and then i believe that the internet is infinite , which is infinite times , in fact , that it 's not <unk> <unk> .
and so , of course , i 've convinced <unk> that people are made to be creative .
and they 're happier as they can be creative .
the more people are happy , the better we go to the world .
very logical .
and the better world is now just one more oil .
in first line , i said , `` i 've said , a storyteller .
and the story i want to share is starting to sit on with midnight <unk> <unk> .
this is <unk> .
and it 's <unk> 's birthday .
now , you get the <unk> , and you do n't sing anything like this , because in the moment it 's gone with something that 's going to happen .
it 's happening in your mind , in your body , with your perception .
and she did n't really have a word for it .
they do n't know what 's happening .
i have words for that .
i call this the wizard wizard of <unk> .
you 're looking at the one hand , and you can see in <unk> , and everything is quite black .
i feel that i 'm kind of <unk> .
<unk> .
and on the other hand , we have a lot of color in the country , with lots of color .
and it 's in this point that i 'm doing better and write than that .
so , the first one , what 's happening with your new perception is an alien man with <unk> hair , who stands to her , she 's very serious , and he says , thank you to look your life .
this is <unk> .
and kiva.org of discovery about this is that it belongs to a very special way of people .
she was born sighted .
players are people who have to play from your wallets 's half hours .
who 's familiar with you ?
very nice .
imagine that the killing of it does n't get away when you meet , but you get out of your pocket .
so <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , everything possible .
and what really matters is , the players do n't have an insight on your <unk> .
we do n't know when we die .
i wish every one long life , but we do n't know .
it can also be tomorrow .
and so it 's also with my players .
they do n't know how much they can play .
that means , every previous possible minute could be the last one .
a player who has his whole lifetime of monopoly , <unk> on the moment of the <unk> like a candle that 's <unk> .
now , you can ask yourself , if that 's as dangerous , why are that ?
and the answer is quite clear : that .
no matter , no player , no player around you , <unk> , everything gray and only when a player plays a player , it 's actually alive .
they were born for games .
here .
this story of <unk> , and as you can now <unk> the world of the player 's first challenges , and of course it 's the story i want to share .
and it 's in form of a <unk> .
the first one is 12 consequences , sorry , and she 's a <unk> here i 'm just late .
so 12 implications in the first store with a distance from one five to seven minutes .
this type of <unk> , a series of the other , beautiful <unk> , that you know .
the tv power for his host department is not anything .
that 's not new .
and if it 's , then i 'm ready to go first .
and also not here .
now it 's just going on .
let 's go back to <unk> .
what is the most famous sentence from the movie or out of the series ?
it can only be one , right .
thank you .
as if we had practiced .
and that 's exactly what my players are not .
there 's lots of giving out many .
there 's so many different games .
think of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so on and so forth .
and that 's exactly the number of players as well .
and so , some of the stories that want to everybody want to be told .
now the next question is : who 's all telling you ?
i have a quite high love of me .
i think of these kinds of smart smart and lots of creative .
but i know that a hundred brains produce more than just one , even if it 's mine .
and that came out to the idea that you have the crowd to the creative process .
what if we just just unravel , or then even ?
so when you say , we 're going to invite you all of your life , which is the development of this session .
imagine , for example , in a way , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
and they 're a big fan of <unk> .
and you 're just able to do it with the technology today , it 's not so hard to do .
and this store is it on the front of the <unk> , where it 's right , and that 's what 's really cool , which is really interested in .
that means , it 's not somewhere under it , but it 's right there , right where it 's supposed to land .
the really beautiful thing is that we are on the internet .
and in the internet , you can really do everything .
so , every medium of medium is kind of allowed .
that 's what you can write as just as the audience , they 're going to draw , swirl , whatever you want .
and if we look at this structure , we look at this structure .
this looks a little bit of <unk> web , right ?
this is something that <unk> together .
and i 'm really confident that convinced that the internet was born , to tell exactly this kind of stories .
it 's not only though , unfortunately , not so much , not yet .
so now i 'm even going to go one step further and let the audience become the player .
it 's in a <unk> .
there you can do it from the characters of the series against people in the real environment , which they have also in their cell phone .
<unk> , which you know are all very good , is something like mobile <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
these are the wonderful areas that are going to be very rapidly .
and i ca n't go to , because i would take another one day .
we feel once again .
each time it 's consists of three parts .
the first part is the <unk> , the second part of the <unk> , and then we have the <unk> .
so with that preamble , i could have the judges of the day , right , i have to be able to be able to tell you the moment : the <unk> innovation .
they gave me the first price for the best gods .
and i have to tell you , this is from <unk> , from the <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
so to people , you should say .
and if i can do that , here with me , the internet is really using structures , the way to the world , i think , can i have to convince everybody .
here .
everyone is : why does this matter so ?
because of all the parts of this , all the parts of the world are turned around .
now , we looked at the bottom line : who is it , i 'm on , you 're on , you 're on , you 're on , you 're on .
and then , of course , dying .
it 's going to have a lot of people in this series .
everyone means , everybody needs to die .
and then , of course , every one of you can ever come if he wants .
it 's totally important to me .
i 'm going to come out of the <unk> , and there 's nothing worse than i think , as if it 's blocking it .
i do n't know if you know .
if you 're in the theater , and then you get the actor in the auditorium and all like that , oh , dear , please me .
and that 's not what it is .
so , of course , volunteers volunteers .
and nobody needs .
it can be just viewer .
the reason i 'm talking about is that the whole project is going to be in the german as well .
that has a couple of reasons .
i came up with this project , and i was always asked , well , do you go to english , to get bigger , blah , blah .
and i can just say , the german <unk> is the third of the world .
the <unk> is the english , and then comes up and then the german .
so it 's not like we 're going to move ourselves into any small scale .
furthermore , i think , really , really , if there 's other people , people get grateful for something , that the people will not be grateful , where at the end of every <unk> and every <unk> .
so , if this is what i like to do , then the first step is now the first step online now .
and if you ask this question why i 'm here with a <unk> , where it 's under the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i also made some thoughts .
i love <unk> .
not just <unk> .
i 'm also quite sensitive to the <unk> and <unk> .
some of them were <unk> and <unk> .
and i can just say that this whole knowledge is incredibly important and incredibly <unk> .
but it does n't use everything to do when you do n't .
and my project is just <unk> , where i 've just learned everything that i learned .
and it has done .
and i 'm doing good .
i can just say that .
so , if you think , i really want to think about my part , i had an idea of nature , or i 'm playing `` i 'm playing `` i <unk> cartoon , '' or whatever , that 's what it 's now .
you find it on the internet .
on facebook .
so , great , the speaker talks .
yes , <unk> .
you know , can you delete some memory memory ?
ask you .
you can make some memory ?
can you remember what 's happened in your life ?
have you ever remember tandem ?
who else remember ?
there is no hands up .
so you can use some memory ?
it seems to be .
thank you very much .
no , that 's what we do n't want to do today .
and then the talk is a pretty short .
again , good evening , my name is samuel <unk> .
the talk today tonight i 've chosen is because he 's two of my passions or my two great work .
i 've studied this very quickly here in the near world , and i 'm doing myself with the bits of bits and the bits of things that are now big through the world .
and most time , i 'm also as coach and <unk> in the private field of the private field .
so on the one hand , i have a lot of busy with the computer , on the other hand , i 'm now in the human <unk> <unk> , so , how does this help human ?
how do you change the difference ?
that 's what it gives you comparison .
i was a very interesting discussion about artificial intelligence , <unk> <unk> .
so , the question was , when can we build a computer that works like the human brain ?
so , and i 'm quite close to that .
so , i think , `` three hundred years , longer need no longer .
but let me do it , you know , why you might have a little bit about doing this .
so , between the computer , between the computer , between the computer , and our brains on the other side .
if we take the computer , it 's all your smartphone , your tablet , your <unk> , your <unk> , and you can also have these cameras , and all of the smart entities have a chip on your <unk> little chip .
it 's called <unk> , central <unk> .
these are the parts that are <unk> from a lot of transistors .
the word is already before , and it 's always going to be as a triangle .
the <unk> little device has three times , and you 're able to do it through current or not .
in our own computer , we have <unk> , about five hundred hundred of these small units .
and they 're getting out crazy .
we 're doing things , we do things that we had a lot of einstein saying , yes , appreciate the computer can be very much , very quickly , but actually he can only compare it .
it can not be .
it 's actually quite toxic .
let 's compare it with your brain .
our brain has a little tiny unit of the neuron , and we have a little bit of it , and we 've got a hundred billion neurons here , a hundred billion neurons are in our gray dimensions up there .
the beauty is , our neurons are not just three connections , and they 're going to <unk> per neuron .
and that makes a <unk> <unk> from just because it 's nice , 10 trillion .
these are 10 to a month of 14 .
so , you can see the complexity of the brain , and it 's a few more than what we have right now .
if we want to compare the <unk> times , maybe one or another , the first supercomputer , who had your own brain email , the <unk> , and with the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> was <unk> .
and then our <unk> <unk> , sometimes , but the box here takes about 20 watts .
and that 's the equivalent of two great bananas , so you do n't need you , and you 're going to be wonderful .
now , if we now <unk> some good part here , <unk> some good computers with <unk> , why do n't we use that , why do n't we do things ?
maybe one of the things in the internet , you might know , the human species on the internet , the human person is only 10 percent of its brain , you 're now able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
and <unk> here , advertising is a little bit .
ten percent yes , but the brain is yes , in the course of our evolution , this crowd has been <unk> , but in the middle of the middle , there 's still a little bit of our <unk> in the middle , but it has everything else has created .
that 's not happen , because we do n't use it .
why is it that we let the biggest part of that ?
maybe you know the notion of the <unk> ?
and i 'm going to keep it up with this bird when you look at this thing , in the ocean , in the ocean , in the ocean , you get the tube , the surface comes down .
and those 10 percent of the top is roughly what our world is , our <unk> mind , but it 's <unk> percent , which runs a giant <unk> .
we <unk> the statement of <unk> we have <unk> <unk> , we <unk> <unk> .
and to put out <unk> on this memory , maybe that one or other people with <unk> memory .
people who come in a lot more detail than i do n't have to be seen in the situation , and then you say , `` how do you know ?
this is because there 's a special place , a <unk> , a <unk> , somebody in a plane , in a plane , in a plane , in a plane so fast , in a plane , in a plane , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast , in a plane so fast
and it 's not kind of a kind of flow here , and there 's this , no , every single house , every single door , every single month , every single one , every single one he has ever seen .
so where does this come from ?
so , why ca n't we , well , the problem is , most of the things that you 're going to have to access to its <unk> percent .
now , we 're now using this , but why ca n't i remember the <unk> last night , in all the details ?
<unk> <unk> of mine has made some interesting experiences .
and he used to have been working in the building industry , and it has been developed with a minister who had been designed by your experience , that was not what the <unk> <unk> of the brain , that 's not going to happen .
wonderful , it came very well .
now , it 's about making people <unk> .
so she 's in a very safe interview , in the end or after this event , even if you could n't remember it , you could see the hallmark of the car in which these guys were <unk> , that would not be the state of the feet .
and indeed , with this quest , one of the people have been .
the second thing i found was really amazing , it was a lady in <unk> , who told her mother 's been read , and she was a little bit of it as she was , and she was a little bit like four years .
and she sat on her mother her mother and her mother .
and then he said , in the <unk> , <unk> .
and then she started to read it , she was four than that , she could n't read at the time , and you could n't read it back today .
and then she said , `` well , let me tell you the <unk> . ''
you 've actually found a specimen of alice in the <unk> , where exactly this page of the text was read the lady .
so the brain has looked like this page , as a picture .
and i could read it .
so yes , we have actually access to it , but we seem to say that in ordinary life , we 're not going to have to have some kind of <unk> that we do n't care about .
now , we now store the incident in yourself , but as a result , he has seen a picture , which is a <unk> , we store our sense , so what we 're saying , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing ,
and , now , it was a lot of time long evening , and you 're gon na get <unk> screens , <unk> little , and then i can close your eyes .
and remember a very , positive event in the telecommunications past , yes .
take the first thing .
and if you do that now , you might notice that you get a visual part .
you may have a picture , maybe even a movie ?
some of you do n't think of it , but that 's what we do it , but that 's what they do .
and if you see that , then you 're either going to be in the movie of your eyes , or how you can see yourself on a canvas .
we call a call we call <unk> the other <unk> .
thank you very much , you can solve the idea back to the mind .
who 's a visual information , you know ?
yes , there 's a couple of hands up here , so i think third about what i 'm expecting it , it 's about something that i think it 's about what we 're expecting , it 's what we 're expecting to do is that it 's about us in the first moment .
well , go on .
but what 's nice is on memories , when you 're practicing memory , it 's not just that memory , <unk> feels a positive event , and i have a or other smile , because it was so that it was beautiful , it was so yes , that it was beautiful , it 's so that you 're laughing , and yet , the memory is still there with our memory , or other emotions .
and now , what 's exciting .
in all of this , you know , well , well , that our brain does n't make any difference between what we actually remember , and what we 're just thinking about what we were looking at .
and you can do that , if you 're sitting at home and you can imagine something that 's not happening , you 're going to put similar information , if you remember what 's in the past .
and , you know , you 've driven these stories that you 've talked in , <unk> , from the time .
and then , hey , there is this happening , and it was so beautiful , and the more pictures of the stories , the more , the more , the other things , you know , there was a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot higher .
if we do that , if we do that , if we 're actually going to change our memories so , why do n't we do this because i mean ?
<unk> , when i came here , my uncle showed up a picture , from his hut in switzerland .
it 's a very beautiful image , it 's a very nice shack .
only , the image is <unk> as a <unk> than the shack , so it 's artistic freedom , and he explains , well , there 's a beautiful dog , because it 's a beautiful dog in the alps .
and why do we do it with our own thoughts , our own memories , said , what else bothers me , if i do this more beautiful , what i think about ?
you 're actually artistic freedom to their own thoughts .
`` do you know what some people that you see in the morning , if you just have that gray eyes , what 's going on ?
yes , i slept in love , i went to the whole <unk> through my head .
i mean , really the whole night and this thought did n't let me go .
i think it 's the other thing that he did not go on .
the son <unk> friend of mine <unk> little depressed than he came to germany , because his mother in the <unk> stayed and he was just terrible .
what the dad did , he has said with the son , and she said , or has said , so what was the most beautiful thing today ?
what was the most beautiful thing , tell the most beautiful , and then he took him to what 's going on him .
and then two weeks , he was doing the son .
and then , it was fine that the pole is gone back to visit .
and the problem is today the whole adolescence is about this , which is one of the smartest people i know .
so it 's not the memories that influence us , where we are , but it 's our focus on what 's going on .
and how much energy we use to use or use .
so , if you 're <unk> <unk> , you know , that 's shown today , that 's what i do n't know that , you know , tom <unk> , you know , tom 's <unk> , you know , tom <unk> , you know , tom 's <unk> , you know , tom 's <unk> , you know , `` tom editor , you know , tom 's <unk> , you know , tom 's <unk> , you know , tom 's <unk> , '' he said , `` tom 's <unk> , '' he has these <unk> computer , but it 's also , you know , you know , well , you know , tom 's gon na have <unk> , you know , well , you know , well , you know , well , you know , well , you know , well , you know , well , you know , well , you know , well , you know , well , you know , well , you know , well , you know , well , you know , well , you know , well , you know , well , you know , well , you know , well , you know , well , you know , well , you know , well , you know , <unk>
what do we mean , `` well , what 's beautiful , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , that was beautiful , you know ?
and then you take it with it .
take that with your <unk> and let it work .
or if you get somebody else , <unk> , it 's <unk> your boss , or your wife , or her husband , or her husband , or her husband , <unk> , you laugh .
so , take this image here , you 'll put some noise on this picture , you know ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , let 's jump out in the background of horses , yeah , why are you laughing ?
because they 're assuming these thoughts are funny .
and they can handle a lot of a situation with a situation .
so can some of your memory <unk> ?
no , i believe that our brain has so much so capacity to store everything .
it does n't mind , because we can choose to choose free , how strong we focus on , and how important we have an event , a memory , a memory , it 's coming on us .
my <unk> on you to play with the pictures in your head , they use the power of your <unk> and give them every single day to help her .
yes , good afternoon .
thank you very much .
if i ask a party on a party , what i 'm going to do in my spare time and tell you that i put together with friends , and i 'm going to see bright eyes and i 'm going to see shining eyes , and i 'm going to see bright eyes in the head of music , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
now , when i was <unk> that it 's a real leap for classical music , and you 're going to push these tunes <unk> pictures of old people who are in just long <unk> in <unk> rooms and very focused on art .
frank <unk> said to talk about architecture .
and so similar to what we 're doing .
so you can also get a glimpse of what i 'm going to talk about , i have a video clip .
<unk> .
and it 's basically the case in the end of it , right ?
this brings it from my point on the point .
for a while , the <unk> of the <unk> of the work to do something totally different .
we 're going to do today between <unk> and the middle , and have been very early in our youth , which incredible power and joy .
but we also have experienced that the phrase of the <unk> , and the <unk> of us , some joy , well , a little disturbing .
and we 're aware of confidence that the so-called action does n't tell the classical music , classical music , which is the music itself , but it 's your <unk> .
so , let 's imagine the question , how can we create a <unk> that the friends and the force again that we like that .
how do we organize a <unk> program that works beyond the spacecraft 's disintegration ?
we put the parameters that they know from the classical concert , the space , the light , the context , fundamentally .
so let 's take the relationship between the audience and musicians .
normally it 's between the stage and the <unk> .
we 're trying to share this .
here you see a picture of our <unk> .
the musicians are sitting in the audience , drink beer , they 're going to keep themselves in the corner with the worse , etc .
all of this is going to be a bit of <unk> in the evening .
anybody who knows , coming on the stage and goes back .
or the sit in the concert .
in the classical concert , it 's like you 're looking at more or less comfortable solid , so that you get here like you , sitting and listen to the front and listen .
but there 's music that you ca n't sit on .
and we did what to do it .
if you sit different , you can hear a <unk> piece of music , you hear automatically differently .
and it 's coming out that we do n't have a stage at this concert , but four stages in the audience .
the audience could <unk> themselves .
so in the evening everyone once again in the first row .
what matters for us is that we do n't just do whatever we do n't , but that we think of the music .
so that 's what we 're asking , what are the spaces of the spaces and the world , but also in the minds of the people , the music is that they can do so ?
and so , at night , at night , at night , <unk> at night , 30 in <unk> , in clubs , in clubs , on the old rock .
but not just the spaces and the lighting can be alive and are now , but also the connection with others .
and so we 're very happy that we 've been talking to a couple of years to work with a few years ago , and we 've had a few years ago that we 've been broken with a few years ago , which did not have been written by the dancing .
and so then <unk> for <unk> of beethoven and for <unk> of steve reich .
and in this year , we have one , yes , yes , yes , yeah , yeah .
we first had a concert a concert with a <unk> .
we 've got the story of the soldiers of <unk> <unk> <unk> with actors , the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> .
that 's what it works , because we had a big <unk> that works in that piece .
we have a lot of money from people from completely germany , so that we could take that .
at all this one , it 's something that comes out of a community .
we 're totally happy in the <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
and the city is exactly that we find great spaces and exciting places for concerts , but also so small that we are trading .
if the last year in the spring of the year in the spring of the year in the spring of the year in the spring of the year in the spring of the year in the spring of the year in the spring of the year in the spring of the year in the spring of the year in the spring of the year in the spring of the year in the spring of the year , we 're just going to fall
the whole thing that we 've managed to do is to do it .
we 're hiring a stimulus of students from students and students , illiterate , <unk> , <unk> , really completely remixable .
and it 's a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> or coordination and funding in the eye , <unk> seven to 10 , 10 to 10 , a year that 's going to take a lasting task .
it turns out , but they 're worried about a year that 's the <unk> or the <unk> , the <unk> in your own hands are hands up to the <unk> .
we all make it all of our leisure and lives in all germany .
that means that the vast majority of the work is going to be entrepreneurial and on a <unk> .
only three times in the year , we 're meeting over the year to a nuclear war , <unk> , you want to talk about the <unk> or another problems that have arrived , and also the human thing that 's really extraordinary about when you want something in motion .
so , 20 to 30 volunteers for a few days or a few weeks , can bring her hands and push where help with the help in the <unk> , the <unk> .
and of course , in those 14 days , the musicians comes to it .
now , you could have to do whatever you need to do it .
but our <unk> goes on .
we have a big community around us in the city of a big community around us to make us what we want to do .
this is what we 're going to do is , but this is practical stuff , but it 's really practical things like this , because we have a baker who has empowered us with a bread or a <unk> that has been making fresh foods .
the tera system is going to have done in a store in the town over the whole year .
to the <unk> .
we 've found a whole range of the living living living living living living living living living living living living living living living living living living living living living living living living living living living living living living living living living living in the challenge so we can see the blueprint .
and in this way , the role of it has become something which has become something which has become a little bit of it and the people in this city .
they 're looking at a very special way of this floating .
for the beginning of the year , we could have <unk> support from the citizens to have a pediatrician in life , which is now that the whole needs to be a <unk> and <unk> .
and we followed by the fact that classical music comes as well as they come into the right hands .
that 's why we are incredibly happy about that in all of europe young musicians in their own hand and start in the cities .
now , if you 're still able to imagine the right now as well as it feels classical music , you just get over .
the beginning of next year we 're back again , and we would look at us if they 're there .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learn .
you might think about it .
you know , you know , to learn to learn or the effect of learning , but i mean , to learn much more , you know , a lot more .
you know , you know , experience a beautiful formula for the <unk> .
so , what i 've learned from art and culture , well , i can tell a lot of natural , because of course , this is what i 'm doing in this field .
and that 's why i 've been thinking that maybe it would be right , this is something that might give you a little bit more likely to give my talk .
art is beautiful , but it 's a lot of work .
they 're also laughed at this .
you always get the laughter , even though most people know .
why is this ?
i think that this is what we can do with the word beautiful is what we can do .
art , that 's what we sometimes say , that 's what we sometimes .
to work , we 're going to say that .
sometimes there too .
the people who want to work , that 's what i want to work .
but at work , we think about the <unk> and the art that 's more than the realm of the realm of the realm that we 're moving inside , our experiences , our own ideas .
and so i 've shared my <unk> , which i want to share with you now in about three hours , who have all the headline , with one i starts , so it 's really easy for it .
it starts with <unk> , for a childhood , looking at the inspiration , for my youth , i 'm not going to tell you all of my youth , no concern , go on , and then i 'm not going to tell all of my youth , not worry , i 'm not going to tell you , i 'm not going to tell you , i 'm not going to tell you the word `` i 'm going to explain why i took this for my <unk> . ''
interaction for the first part of my professional life and then , fifth , whatever .
<unk> of one of you will know these pieces of <unk> <unk>
<unk> , two and <unk> .
you learn that in the first two , three , three years , if you have a <unk> , and i have lived .
and it 's like , 11 , i played these little pieces on the piano , not far from here , at the <unk> , at home .
these pieces live by a <unk> .
there 's a melody and playing the other voice , but it 's very different .
the rhythm is the same , but it 's <unk> .
and that , ladies and gentlemen , is something that is a thing that is that the art is that it can be , and if it 's only two voices , bringing together together to think of whether that the present , the future , the past , pictures , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , things that are <unk> on the moment that makes art .
and i learned two , two , sometimes also three , to play with the <unk> <unk> , at the same time , to play any way to play , any kind of thing you know , the other one .
that was what i 've learned about , among other things .
another particular experience , i have never forgotten , and i 've had the worry that it might be something like this .
i have a piano , and there was more people sitting in the room than today , and in the <unk> , i came out .
i had forgotten it .
i did .
so again , and i did n't really know the same position , and i did n't really know again .
the audience has more complex than i , because i went on to my place , i got my notes , put it back and started the third one .
and you do n't think about what they 've been behind .
but that was a very heavy experience .
maybe that was one of the experience where i knew , well , with no piano , even though i had a <unk> , i do n't think , because i wo n't cheat .
yes , the next chapter i have , i have <unk> with inspiration , and i want to tell you stories .
when i was that <unk> , i went to my <unk> , and i said , `` you know , mr. <unk> , i want to play a <unk> play .
and he said , `` well , that wo n't .
you have to have visited lots and lots of experience with women .
now imagine a <unk> young man , so young , so that 's a sentence .
i did n't forget that .
and of course , i 've got more even more .
now , i 've been off , by the way , by the way , and at the way , in a <unk> .
i 've practiced and i remember a situation that i 've never met .
it was the reckless <unk> of the chopin , and now i 'll get into the part of work , and she was the most beautiful place , and she was the most beautiful place , and then again , and then again , and again , and again , again .
i ca n't play it , not a piano here , and i could n't do it .
i took this place 20 , 30 times a little bit , and suddenly it came right .
and then i continued to go and <unk> , i got myself into a <unk> , and i just know that i was eating myself on the ground and laughing .
i was there .
i had nothing , nothing done , and the music did this with me .
now , a experience where i 've learned , are really going to make the emotions to do this .
and sometimes it 's really true to work that you can call it <unk> in that condition , in this condition , i call it .
where everything runs .
we had this situation , actually , in the <unk> scale , in an organization .
there was almost everything like this , when we did the <unk> , that only two months , where you would normally need a year .
well , that was my experiences with my piano , with artistic toys with artistic work .
and now i 'm going to come to my background , <unk> .
i was first sighted as a musician , but only as a <unk> .
we have played <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and i 've given it <unk> , and i was standing there , because i was supposed to love the music next to the music .
in the choir , there 's breathe , a <unk> , wonderful experiences that i have very , very further .
and then a point came up with where i was <unk> in the <unk> theater , in the <unk> and the administration , and i have this sort of <unk> with <unk> <unk> , this chapter , and i was walking in that combination of art , and politics and law enforcement became a profession .
art is the art art to make culture , to make the culture .
so , the art here is the art , but not as artists , but it would n't be <unk> , but as a <unk> <unk> and more and more .
i was there in theater , and i was <unk> there in germany , there was no such jobs for me , just in vienna , there i am , and i 'm going on , and i 'm going on , and i 'm going on , and i 'm going on , and i 'm going on , and i 'm going to talk to this question , what can we do to do art to improve art , to make a good management tool to build a good cure ?
and that was the reason i was getting out of my job in my professional , in direction that <unk> , and when i was <unk> , i was <unk> .
but before , in the other hand , another <unk> , and that 's what i did with interaction with interactions .
<unk> i came to the germans .
the german <unk> has its <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm <unk> , even though sometimes in my résumé , because i was born in <unk> , the <unk> oliver <unk> , so i 'm sorry , i kind of have to be <unk> .
but i have a <unk> root , because my maternal grandparents were also <unk> , and there , in <unk> , i 've had the <unk> .
and that was what i did n't have loved , and suddenly i became a different kind of culture in a <unk> , in a culture that was living by people in this <unk> device .
and as soon as the <unk> respond to us , all of us were in a completely different situation in the very different states .
and i put up with the <unk> and <unk> <unk> , who was my friend and colleague , because we 've always done for the <unk> night music , he was left , i was going to have the piano , for example , i could <unk> at the time .
we did the <unk> <unk> , but of course on texts of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
and this <unk> , that 's really from people .
it was my destiny that i was at home november november , and i did n't know that the wall fell .
i was looking at the next day , i had an awful exam , oh , the wall is like , yes .
i 'm going to ask me quickly to any questions on any questions .
and i was <unk> for the cities in the south condition .
and that 's where i 've experienced again , like interactions , in between two german cultures .
in fact , we speak the same language , the music will also be beautifully , and it 's wonderful , but a lot of a lot , <unk> .
unlike the world cup , it 's not one of the people , but it came up , and i have a lot of the top , and i have a big conflict here to experience how the german identity , i come back to that , again , slowly again , and the german flu , then these two states have come through these places .
since then germany is <unk> .
since then , in fact , there 's a lot more more mature 2.0 .
interaction , i have learned to all sorts of things , experienced in the city .
we 've got a <unk> , and i started to think of that when i started here , <unk> , was on my <unk> for culture and play .
i still have .
`` <unk> '' for <unk> , you did n't want to write <unk> for culture and <unk> .
so i was the first dream of <unk> .
so i do n't have time so much , so , the wonderful thing that i had this sort of <unk> , but she was also going to be in charge for education and storage to education to education .
we 've done very much for urban urban transport , we have just given this analog between <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , what we 've designed to have , where you have to see interactions between how to experience interactions , <unk> , where you have interactions between the stage and architecture , from the <unk> to the blue sector .
many , many interactions , we could get us and i could have been designing , and realize what that means when different people come from different backgrounds together .
and by the way , you notice that i always get more and more complex of the art , more and more and more of the art that we care about us , between cultures , between communities , and in the communities , in the communities , and i 'll come back to art afterwards .
interaction , it 's between the <unk> of the subject as we , <unk> , seven <unk> was the idea that the idea of january <unk> , the <unk> could hold around the <unk> community .
but this last chapter , this is the fifth act ever ,
so this word has two meanings to one , and i can use it with something , and i 'm also able to use it as verb and say , i 'm going to see something that means , i know something .
and it 's always in his <unk> .
i do something with his <unk> , so i say , i say , i 'm standing you , or that community .
and i 'm doing something that i 'm going to identify with something , and i say , that 's what i want to identify with me .
and that 's a really big deal .
five of three million people trying to move up , <unk> cities , moving cities in the ways that they are a community in europe .
as a big , we called it <unk> , but anyway , as a community of many people who live in a big life of life and yet a common language , even when there 's a <unk> nations , and that was our environmental technology that was intended to date with the people , and that 's , of course , a lot to do it .
at the sign of the highway , the highway , the highway , many other experiences .
now , one of the things that we have n't seen was a lot of people .
and young student from <unk> school and food , two schools , worked out , young girls from <unk> school , from <unk> <unk> , young girls from <unk> school , from <unk> <unk> , young girls from <unk> school , <unk> , <unk> , who wrote the last letter .
and it was a curious effect that young girl loved letters from boys and young russians and young russians , letters from young men from germany in a little <unk> german .
and then one of those young men sat down the piano , and she was this <unk> i loved .
and then , he quoted out of a letter , and she said , `` i 'm <unk> , he wrote his home , as a young german , '' he said , and i never play one more thoughtful .
and he <unk> his finger with a revision , he <unk> himself in this piece of <unk> and tried to play the <unk> .
and he did n't even .
it was such a <unk> film that i was <unk> , so , what did we learn ?
we 've learned in the finance islands that many people can move together , but in fact , we have learned that we have <unk> years in <unk> in peace and the culture that we do n't identify the minds , because we are discussing to connect ourselves .
and that was a wonderful experience , and you can see , it 's not just about learning .
it 's all about learning to be able to get some experience and <unk> .
and when we 're a lot of power and invention , if we tolerate it that we inspire ourselves from art and culture , our own position , in the diaspora with the piece of us , and ultimately , we have won art and culture , we all have won .
and i 'm hoping that they have a lot of <unk> and <unk> that they pull that profit .
thank you very much .
yes , thank you very much .
i think we 're going to wait on the first image .
so i have to give up to the support of my device here , some slides .
but it 's not a scientific thing , but it 's about a theme here in my career here , and i think that will give us the next years .
by the most popular words , i can finally finally , thank you very much for what ted means , and i think , in the area , i 'm going to let this talk .
and then i had heard that you should think of the talk in english , if somehow possible , but if you look at it , you 'll see what i wanted to say in english , i did n't know how to say it , and so i did the talk to german .
we 're going to die .
i 've got to tell you about this <unk> .
<unk> , patient in the hospital i <unk> the <unk> , and was <unk> .
she was over over <unk> years old , and he likes to be famous in may , because she remembered her husband , the first man who was in war .
and so she went to the dance for the first may be a long time , and then , you know , a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then the car , and you 're standing here on the right side , and you see that the leg burst , the <unk> .
a couple of years before , she was also in the same way , and the same way to broken up the left leg .
and then i was also there as a doctor and i have been seen , how did i was treated with antibiotics , how she was treated with antibiotics , and have the discussion , which is all that sense ?
does it make it sense to make such a kind of useful people using this kind of intense model ?
so , come to <unk> , based on the intensive care , is that a human being <unk> ?
and she has been cured .
five years later , i 'll go in the clinic , see the name <unk> , and i can remember it because it 's so rare for the time at the time , and the dance rate broke the other leg again .
so , you know , the question is , what do i do when i talk about how a human being , what he 's going to do in his <unk> or what he 's also in the <unk> ?
and that 's sort of a bit of the theme of this .
so you can see here the letter of the jungle as we 're going to die .
it 's a book from <unk> that we 're going to work , a report in the <unk> .
and then it was that the globalization was very strong so that you 've been wondering , how can it go to work ?
you 've got it , and you can also have shown in this book , you know , it 's going to be a quality of the parts so the parts of the parts .
it becomes a relationship of work in the work , it 's going to be a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot more , for example , in china , that was a big topic .
and that 's also that in fact , the work of the individuals , then , a little bit , more <unk> , that it 's used increasingly efficient from the quality that he <unk> , from the accuracy .
and that , after my interaction , people could be able to pull away from their work out of their work , and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more of a small
and if we transmit that moment on the <unk> and the medical space , there 's this one trend .
if you hear tv in tv , what doctors and caregivers and <unk> , most of the <unk> , it 's called the <unk> .
and this is not something else , as it needs to be used to what you have done so that it 's being paid for it , and if it is , then the medical service , and that medical treat , we do n't pay .
and with this stage , it 's going to be stronger and stronger , and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more , this idea that you
now , a good friend of mine has gone up to a meeting , because he did n't want to go to this , who had a <unk> practice , and he went to kenya to become a doctor .
the <unk> of all of this , as a result , is a piece of time , and he said , who had martin , had been found that more old people would have seen that , in the middle of the <unk> , the hospital , and back , because the <unk> did n't know what they should do when it was worse .
and then you get into the hospital , then then go back to your home , or <unk> , and they 're going to go there .
and this kind of thing was happening , if there is such a little bit wrong in holland , then i would like to let me train , to make something a little bit here , that you can <unk> out of this vicious cycle of the <unk> and the same <unk> of people .
there , in the netherlands , he had to look at the language of the language , after he had learned the language of what had been learned in the language of this auditorium .
it becomes more connected to die as well .
it 's not the <unk> that counts , but you want to go to a <unk> , or not in the hospital when i 'm in the <unk> .
and then the <unk> system .
in fact , it 's like this , the third days is a conversation with the patient instead , and then you have to do it , i want to be a hospital or i do n't want to the hospital when i want something .
so with the thing that i want to be going to be , or i want to be misused .
this data is going to go to a center and it sits on this physician for <unk> , and it has the <unk> decision on this basis .
now , if we can think of <unk> , which i would like to think about the may , and it 's also completed , and we imagine that would have written a band , i want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a <unk> , and then she would have a second dance in may where she 's going to come back to the other day where she 's going to come back , you know , you know .
and that gave my friend now who is standing in the netherlands , as well as much as he 's supposed to handle it .
so in the last , it 's probably about performance to 70 percent of the people 's home , but in hospitals , and then that it can be well , but in hospitals , and that it can be well , in hospitals , and that it can be well , so you can do that , not the ideal , but it 's often held to the <unk> , and you can find that <unk> , and you can find that <unk> , and you can find that <unk> , and you can find that <unk> , and you can think of that <unk> , and you can think of that <unk> , and that 's where i think that 's just limited .
there 's bad gene , which leads to do this very well , there are very vague people who are flying around , but when i look at the <unk> , and we have about <unk> patients in the year , so i would say to myself , it 's quite difficult to cope and his inner self-worth .
all of course , of course , most important reasons , this is clear , that all of the educational system , is that all of the people will be inferior to religion , and that the people who care about , or the medical achievements , they say , well , i 'm going to say , well , i think , well , i can get a family with one or two children .
now , that 's just not a reality , but it takes two copies in the <unk> and <unk> , and it 's also only scarce .
this introduction of quality control as a result of a fish that you want to regulate , and then you get to the individuals .
and now i 'm going to get away from how you can get out of that , and so what do we do right now , because i 've been asking you , and i show you , so that 's really simple , the situation is simple .
and then i 'm just doing the <unk> <unk> , and the paper on one hand there is because i think a society needs to make this structure and legal structures that we do all of the <unk> of what happens in our society .
and in the <unk> article , one thing is that people would be <unk> .
and the second one is to protect them is the red issue .
and what i lack is , is a third sentence in here , that every single one would be to protect his dignity and defend .
because that 's a way to remove himself from this event , i 'll give it to another way , and then i do n't think about what i 'm dying for .
because at the last , it 's like , even if we 're not like to ask this topic , we 'll be able to get to the point .
hopefully late , with a hundred or <unk> .
so , of course , that 's what i want to do is , of course , my profession , i wish to say that i want to be concerned , but at some point , you 're going to make the subject , and if you 're <unk> , <unk> or <unk> or <unk> , it can be late in life , i want to think about this question .
now , if you think about it , what does this mean , then you 're going to get on the dots where then you get in the last , so , in my life ?
there 's a book now , which is rather <unk> .
it 's the military of course , there are the friends that i have , and i can exchange myself through life , it 's the <unk> .
it 's safe in trust between people that i may have to do , in the nabati sector , or a minister or a <unk> or whatever other people i compete with .
and there 's lots of thousands of times many of the many of the factors that are there , and i do n't go up now .
but if you look at these three points , you 've got a whole lot of tasks , like you might have to be able to protect your own .
and then another issue is that we have a certain sort of dictatorship in the molting experience , i 've got this one like a text or as an example of that .
other people can make these decisions , and this behavior , which <unk> , not meet .
that 's my inner belief .
we would just come from ourselves .
so it 's not the question , what will be different to me , who 's going to provide me , or to me , who goes to me ?
it 's the same way to ask , where can i take me to humans , where can i bring myself , and i think , my inner network would be , and i can use and play with it .
and then , when you tell how we 're going to work , this sort of <unk> that has been moving away from the outside , it 's a way to say , and i snatched my inner execution , that 's mechanism .
because no human beings can tell me how i can see myself and you can .
and i do n't have to fit into general <unk> or opinions that say you 've got to be able to go to you now and because you 're a lot of old , you know if you want to be going to get to a meeting .
these are questions that i can think about just after long , is probably <unk> .
and this would be an inner posture , which is in my mind , and not by the outside of the state , the state ca n't protect the state , and that i would have to do other people , you know , that the state can not protect , so that the knowledge i am for a human .
and to make these conversations , it takes place in spaces , and there , i think , and i think , and that 's why i 've described this talk , and there 's such spaces like this <unk> , so that it 's not really theoretical , but that 's a conversation that is happening there .
so if we 're old , if we 're old , you might say , well , this dance in the may , despite my very high age , that would be even more .
thank you very much for your attention .
beautiful evening .
let me bring two things .
so , if you have to flat the first part , you 'll think a little bit more . ''
it 's still a second .
let 's start with infinite space .
that 's stupid , not .
what do you mean ?
is there different <unk> ?
huh enough enough ?
yeah .
that 's not good when there 's something that 's looking at .
so in fact , but i 'll put it to the people who know it .
that 's exactly what we do .
we just are just using ourselves with one .
and i was like to get it to the <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , you know , infinite form we can .
and it 's all the way to the <unk> of all of these things .
if we 're on the back road , and we count two <unk> , in one of the other people .
we know , well , we already look at the box in the box , the number is small , it 's three chairs and there 's three people .
we can see if any of the same number of elements is that ?
and count , how would we do it ?
that means , we would just take the people together , one , two , three , we get the chairs , we get the chairs , see three chairs , three chairs , three chairs , three chairs , three chairs , three chairs , three chairs , three chairs .
i mean , yeah ?
very nice .
that works in the building , that works in large numbers , even though it does it .
but it works .
how do you count it ?
how do you think so many people like us ?
i have consciously forced out and people , and not what else .
let 's leave it !
it 's called <unk> .
you know , that 's clear , right now , now we 're on your day-to-day life , and you all know that !
not , that 's very nice .
so , you 've got this <unk> and it works as well , yeah ?
you take one , you put yourself on a chair out of the mouse .
the next <unk> , the next <unk> , all of it is , several people there are going to get different chairs , not a chair in empty and the amount of blue , okay ?
now we 're going to go into the infinite system .
so how can we compare two infinite amounts of interactions ?
we would say , well , this is so large or bigger or smaller than the other .
we could do it ?
we would begin again .
right , that 's wrong because the point is because the point is , when you start in a infinitely long way , yes , i would n't say you 're not going to another .
<unk> , infinitely , is clear , <unk> ?
so , what about it ?
pardon ?
no way , <unk> !
and she had a really started .
mate !
so now let 's look at that .
estimate it is bad , yes , yes ?
you do n't see it , yes , yeah ?
the point is this , you 're doing it very simple .
now , if i take to take , for example , the <unk> , natural numbers , <unk> , we 're going to push the zero at the beginning , zero , one , two , three , four , five .
and we would have , say , a replica of this spine , and we take this sample of the <unk> of <unk> numbers .
just the straight numbers , okay , zero , two , six , six , six , <unk> ?
okay ?
all straight numbers are <unk> on the infinitely long graph of the natural numbers , but on the <unk> of the <unk> , on the other hand , is the straight and the <unk> , right ?
let 's call that a lot of <unk> the straight numbers , we call the other amount of <unk> numbers .
what do you think ?
is a <unk> powerful , is it bigger than strategy , or smaller ?
number big ?
now , this is very common , yes , in the one hand , you know .
who else ?
smaller ?
who makes bigger ?
now , who did n't really plan , yeah ?
so that can not be true , yeah ?
you ca n't , where what is missing , is bigger , that 's not , <unk> ?
okay , so you say little ?
do you think ?
that 's the most popular thing you 're supposed to be wrong , of course .
now , now i tell you why the number is equal .
how does it work ?
right .
yes , we mate .
that 's the point .
we mate .
we take the zero away , we take the zero from the natural crowd , mate out .
the next one of the zero , after plus two comes two , one , and i 'll get a <unk> .
the four , the six , the six , the eight , yes ?
you can also reverse it , then it 's going to double , that 's clear , <unk> ?
and the obvious thing is , through the <unk> , it 's what i 'm always going to do in the lecture as an <unk> <unk> .
and here one , because there 's just a straight straight on it , and the tape is in the same time , right ?
we <unk> the natural <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> are gone and the band is still in the same way .
this is just infinite .
so if you explain some of these , what we 've learned today today has learned , yeah , what 's infinite , i just know ?
a infinity amount has a property , which is there 's not in the course , and this trait , is absolute <unk> , which is a real economy that 's been so big .
so you do n't , you know , you 're not going to do this in the course if you 're from three people two people two people , and then only one out there , it 's three .
yes , so we did pull together .
is n't nobody <unk> ?
okay .
then we do a second part of it .
the professionals , some probability .
so what brought up here .
now , at this experiment , i 'm sure , at least , at least , at least , is at least a third of you , and it 's someone who has it on it , right ?
so , let 's call the doors a , b , c .
i was hidden under anything hidden , i hope you 're not heard .
and you 're going to guess now .
court : where do you , i have something hidden behind a , b or c ?
guess what you 're here , our <unk> , here .
they cherish up c .
who else has another idea ?
a ?
who 's still an idea ?
you know , <unk> , b , b is not , you know , you know ?
that 's right .
it really does n't matter , so you do n't have to break out the three letters , and i 'm looking for me .
it 's really anyway , yeah ?
it 's totally clear because it 's the chance they 're lucky , it 's just a third .
<unk> , there 's three things , you really anyway ?
now i do this , i just do one .
well , i know where it is .
<unk> , that 's somebody who 's here , <unk> .
so , i know where it is , and it 's , and it 's like , or whatever you call it , go to a second round .
so i 'm really doing the game now , i 'm now doing now , now , now , i 'm now now .
so it 's like this , we go to a second round .
now , what i 'm say'n on that is a , <unk> ?
so now i 'm going to show you a door behind it , behind it is not what you 're not said .
because if you 're saying b , and i say , well , it 's not behind b .
then there would be no second round .
and i 'll say , <unk> , from the mouse , the mouse .
but i have to think , this is <unk> , in the second round .
so i can only open one open behind that it 's not only not only , but what they do n't say .
now , the question is , and this is the existing probability of the condition , under the condition that b is open , and it 's not behind it , you 've got your last chance to guess new .
now , you can still stay with a stay , i 'm going to give a <unk> .
i do what you want .
or you say , i 'm doing c .
now , is the <unk> economy , is this knowledge of this knowledge ?
so , very beautiful , b is on , now i know it 's behind c .
or , god is that b is open , i always wanted to stay , that 's it .
or if you 're saying , is <unk> , we have , <unk> , gone away , we only have two doors , now it 's no way to stay or stay .
what do you mean ?
it 's not anyway .
<unk> .
why is n't it anyway ?
very nice .
why is this why is it <unk> ?
yes , exactly , that 's wrong .
now , that 's almost like , when we had <unk> it yesterday , <unk> ?
but this is how they are , <unk> , are a new no , fun .
so , the thing is , the thing is really <unk> , yes .
you know , you know , all between , i do n't know , six , and yeah , yeah , i ca n't be <unk> , can i do n't get any more , <unk> ?
so , it 's really happening .
behind this one , it 's up to one third .
and it 's just one third behind one door .
you can guess what you want to do , they 're in the <unk> .
that means , if you can guess , you can guess about two doors , not , you can do it with <unk> , you can put on two dozen , then you 're <unk> , you know , when you give the zero list , that 's what 's in the right life .
but here , we just have one door .
so , this is what you 're doing is .
so the two thirds here , but it 's just behind one door .
it 's not !
so , what is more likely ?
no way , i was really hidden !
so , what is more than more than that ?
it 's better to remain , or demand ?
now it 's easy , yes ?
yeah , of course !
so , that 's not hard to be <unk> ?
ha !
what do we see ?
they have trouble .
why ?
so , two thirds are not a hundred percent : the difference between theory and practice .
i hope it was for every thing .
thank you very much .
mr. <unk> , that they 're shipped to jamie oliver <unk> , who is just eating smart nutrition and bad food , and people who have heard that depressed is completely .
but i <unk> , my best , is gone away from it , this impressions .
i come out of <unk> farm , and i knew until i was n't mcdonald 's .
that 's what i said , right .
well , yeah .
thank you very much for joining today .
i grew up here in the street .
and i do n't know if mr. <unk> has gone on me to ask me if i want to focus on the lake and talk about a particular theme .
i had <unk> <unk> , which is trust .
well , motivation is not bad , and i <unk> myself in the wife who said , maybe it 's a sports or another one .
now , to have full of it .
so today , you know , if you 'd be able to get a lot of good , but i have to get tomorrow to do , because i 'm going to train in a three weeks at the <unk> brothers , at <unk> , at <unk> , which is <unk> miles .
in my mind , the training is not going to get it tomorrow .
so who 's going to have one morning , <unk> , go to the <unk> , and i 'm calling them all welcome .
so i said , `` well , a little bit , i 'm going to trust <unk> . ''
and i started to do extra , <unk> ,
no worry , the nice , little <unk> , blind trust .
and i did n't know what was going on with a moment when i 'm <unk> , how do i show you to where i was driving ?
so , i come from the village with six houses , so , many <unk> , some <unk> , and the parent on the courtyard is apple apples , <unk> and <unk> -- and what do you do .
trust , of course , in sports , of course , in sports , but in fact , <unk> and beer .
why would i tell the story where i am ?
for me , one of the most important stories that i really was looking right from the country , from the village come , and then grew up with two great brothers with the oldest brother , the <unk> .
and with the second brother , the same blind way me .
it 's the light and dark , the way i can see , where the <unk> windows in the room is that it 's light .
and what 's very practical is to go today .
the one , or we can just see if we 're talking about ourselves .
sorry , but i 'm not going to tell you , is <unk> <unk> guy .
the topic of the old men , <unk> .
it 's all grown up to this point .
and , of course , what 's happening for me is , of course , the fact that you trust , and you can see this huge trust , the <unk> that we all need , as a little <unk> situation .
and that was , for my parents , they 're like many of them , and i had no blind .
we were so the first time that 's going to be a relatively suddenly in their lives .
and then they had to do that .
and , now , now i 'm announcing , it 's a great lucky that my parents had to stand up next day to stand up and help us , and say , there 's a <unk> wall , because you can <unk> you , and then you can feel <unk> , where you <unk> .
a thing that 's uncomfortable -- we 've got home .
and b is our parents from beginning to us to go to us to go to where we are at the brother .
so , in the house on the house alone , the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , it also shifted .
there 's the blind brothers with <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> fake .
i mean , the <unk> that i have up to today .
this is the big brothers -- they 're not just good for the sex and for the same brothers .
and we brothers and my brothers and my brothers , and i put them backwards on the yard yard , what could all of these guys could do , especially for example .
and this has been the <unk> brother with enthusiasm , and then we wanted to -- michael and me .
and then , starting with <unk> , like , many of these little kids , in the way , a lot of little kids , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and then you can do that , you know .
but we do it with <unk> , at some point .
and then the big question is : how does ma stop there ?
and how to trust the trust , the trust trust , the children of the children , the children will hold away from the bicycle , and you know , and the other thing that we 're not going to do .
and our solution was that , of course , we have a lot of our parents , where they are the <unk> , so , where there 's a car , where <unk> bites , where , maybe , you might know , there we are .
and we had to have ourselves between ourselves , but we have to hear the other part of the other .
and you ca n't test you , because otherwise it 's going to be so loud , that they have nothing to do .
but <unk> ' evening , if you turn light , and you put them in your bedroom , or in your bedroom , they want to go to you .
you can try to do it , you know , just <unk> your tongue , and you 'll notice that , in the same hand , you get the resistance .
so , as bats as the bats are going to hear that , you know , now , <unk> , <unk> resistance , <unk> resistance because the sound are going to be different .
and that 's for me in trust , so trust it in the motion , always have been important .
but to have high <unk> , and the safety : i have a chance to help me some piece of play .
and i 'm just making a great difficulty , and i sure , also without many accidents that have one or another , of course .
but what i do n't know today today is that i 'm very <unk> , from one of our most successful children .
and one of the land on our higher building is to go to a <unk> farm .
so i wrote this , the aid is also through a <unk> diversity .
and my favorite page i 've been very literally is because i was a human , who also came to a lot of time later on the scientific page , and i never am like i 've experienced it myself .
i 'm never going to have read that as well as well .
but it certainly has to do with that , of course , that , of course , it 's not everybody 's so interesting .
diversity is in the brain of our strengths with the <unk> , to know , where am i good , what am i going to take talent , and where can i do i 'm my strong ?
and our brother go back , and i always came up with the house from the house .
so then , okay , we put a <unk> here .
there 's one thing that you can do somewhere from there somewhere , for example .
and the pavilion then then was , michael and me , he 'd like the girl , `` <unk> <unk> , i do n't know .
but lately , who would like to go down ?
so i do n't .
and i mean , we are the generation of young women here too .
and from that point , i 'm always going to do it .
and then , it was the consequence that we 're going to get together all three <unk> at the top , and the dad with <unk> <unk> , and no longer knew what he 's supposed to say now .
because , of course , of course , of course , the trust is , of course , the other story .
if the dad would have said , to help god will help help , to help , to think about the danger , that one of us would have been afraid , and in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
but it never happened .
and he had to feel like he had <unk> us back slowly , he had to do it again , or he 's <unk> , who was going to us .
and that was what i found for me was really great that we had this opportunity .
but it 's clear , no worry , this is not rocket , not a necessary to make it .
for me , the different <unk> i was always interested in life , everyone , yeah .
and all of all , all of that , you know , because i could n't see myself , where did my borders , maybe my disclosures .
so , i could have heard good samaritan , i could never have .
i never had the <unk> .
and i do n't like to go to today .
i 'm going to go out to today , get into rain .
now , it 's not at five degrees like this .
and in fact , rain -- but still as it is inside .
but i always have to trust it with the trust of trust , that i tried different songs .
and the first one , for example .
and that was , for me , because there 's the coach who had in the sciences , said , ok , we have a lot of kids , but parents ' children have blind kids .
actually , it 's good , because you 're going to stick on each other .
and then you realize what the other is .
and it was always my tall trust , of course , when i 'm going to make the competition for a long time , it 's hard , because then the other one can do what i do n't <unk> .
so there 's just a method that is , and that 's the trust .
the other kind of put a foot into the <unk> , and i let me go out backwards , and then it 's back in the back and the competition is because there 's the full content .
i 'm not trying to do it here .
i was still interested in it .
i mean , this is risky stuff right now .
and i would n't have here today , right ?
<unk> .
sound , i 'm <unk> .
okay .
the next thing that i was important for me is a sports student in high school and just <unk> .
my parents were home or <unk> , and that 's what they teach for children .
but for me , in school , i would be clear in school , how do i move myself too much to school to get my <unk> energy ?
and then i had an opportunity to do the school .
and even though i was always thinking , this is all such as good as it 's boring , because <unk> is something for the most playful , i am .
and i used to do -- i used to do that , i do n't know anymore .
so i would say , well , i 'm doing it with the <unk> .
and so , you know , what you 've discovered is , you know , the big divide here in the sports , because you need <unk> , you need the power , you need good missions ,
now you 've got a lot of your work out of your work ?
that 's what it is in the fueling business .
you 're just going to be fast when you just trust the full trust in your technology .
if you trust the trust in your own performance -- so the force that you 're in every possible condition , the bad weather , the soft weather , when you can get the <unk> , you can move into the <unk> .
and if you have to trust it in my mind .
because as an <unk> that 's not seeing , i <unk> <unk> .
and i 've never been talking about it , like today -- i have to use the word -- my <unk> -- my <unk> -- there 's one -- has my practice .
but nothing , we do it again .
now , let me tell you a little bit more like this , you know .
take one , one of them still came up with another exercise .
so what i 'm always doing is i 'm going to rely on the subject of physics , which is the practice that i 'm going to just think of the listener , like this , if you do n't see nothing like this , and you 're <unk> <unk> .
and when you <unk> <unk> , you 've got two sticks in the hand .
so , of course , i do n't have any hand anymore , otherwise i could take my finger <unk> , and you get the <unk> .
it 's not .
so i have to help me different .
so i was telling my favorite <unk> , which is walking on me .
and that 's what explains my voice .
so it 's got to make the exact <unk> .
and that 's important for trust .
the precision in communication , so in <unk> .
and the soprano answer is always <unk> , when it comes up with me and <unk> , who says , left on 11 , and then i know it 's easy to the left , so i 'm going to get it easy to the left , so i 'm going to get it easy to the left .
when he says , on the left to ten bit , <unk> on the left , and when he says , right on 10 .
okay , anybody all the time ?
then , <unk> problem , because then i have to wake up to you , or i 'm going to fix it , and i know , i know , i know every case , now it 's true .
and for me , it 's really big , critical when the <unk> walks before me , i have to say me to really give a really completely <unk> to say .
in fact , it 's for me to say , it 's for me for me to be the tools that it enables me up to me , but it 's also faster than others that start in the same competition .
and i can just do that , if i do it with both arms to me , <unk> me on a leg , and i really have to make your eyes -- ha ha -- or you can also let it open , it does n't .
then you have to look like this , and then it takes to be on the other leg and the other leg and it gets to be <unk> here , but you have to stand to be quiet .
also with high shoes .
yes , and that 's what i mean , that 's what i 'm going to say , `` how do i look at the guy , the guy , i want to say the guy , and i 'm going to say , `` hey , you have to make the right <unk> because the thing is , i have to make the right hand , because i 'm sure that the right thing is .
so i do n't know what to tell me .
so i 'm the one that has to open your way to communication .
and that 's like joining every <unk> .
if you do n't know my needs , he ca n't help me , but i 'm just asked , and i 'm going to say , well , i 'm going to be able to do something good , and i 'm going to say , well , well , i 'm going to use the curve , you know , suck in the curve .
or i 'm preparing for you , like now , you know , i 'm going to tell you how long the mountain is , because if we first leave the <unk> rung , because if you 're going to think of it , you 'll think about it . now now it 's got to be over .
and , again , just as <unk> and the thing do n't stop on .
and there 's a lot of times that i used to have the pilot behind the pilot , like it said , `` it 's <unk> , '' he said , `` well , maybe 20 minutes behind us , maybe we might -- so we get a little bit of minutes behind us , and then you 'll still have a little bit more like this .
so , of course , that 's what important for me is to have the privilege of being accurate .
i say , `` oh '' -- here 's the other thing that can be <unk> <unk> ?
who 's more ?
so my best time , however , it was already faster in september , and now , in april , i did n't have a moment that much faster than <unk> .
and at the moment , it 's very <unk> at the moment .
and for me , as i said , this is the exact extension of only possible when i just open my ears .
the other thing that i 'm trying to do is explained exactly what he can see , and the possibility of my risks perfectly .
and that 's one of the really important things i say : trust is more training and not that <unk> <unk> .
so if you do n't have a blind blind , you know , it 's like -- from <unk> .
because i had the experience that i had the experience that i had a <unk> on the right with the left .
and then it was in the competition of my competition , because it 's next to three feet .
and i 'm half the three meters .
so , as i said , that was -- of course .
and i do n't know that because the <unk> have got to turn around , so <unk> <unk> .
and i happen to me today , people say , left , and say , <unk> , the other links .
so then the right , unfortunately .
do n't often do so much so much .
but it 's clear , in <unk> situation with pressure , that you probably know all of the work , or the daily decision , you have to go quickly .
and of course , of course , there 's also a lot of a lot of reality , of course , is really hard challenge .
but for me , as i said , `` self-confidence , '' mainly what i need to know the risks .
and i need to say , i 'm as somebody who does n't see , quite big in the advantage , because i 'm saving my risk in many ways .
so in the <unk> , i 'm so much everybody .
from driving the <unk> tree from drop down , which i know , and i 'm sure -- and that 's the point -- i 'm also doing good pages .
and then you can also be able to be able to trust that .
and if you 've found it , the only way that you 've found , the only way that you do .
and with the same thing as i did the same thing .
because that 's what i 'm doing with trust is the next thing , really interesting .
you need the same end , and you have to be clear , what does it mean , trust it ?
because it 's often <unk> that you use .
i trust that or the or me .
but the most important thing about , yeah , is that it 's too much .
it 's that you 're supposed to be a lot of <unk> .
and then you 're also -- because we do n't want to take rid of <unk> <unk> <unk> -- we want to see them overlapping .
and the point that it 's very often is that we can also create the long-term target .
that we 're going to do it -- in my case , for example , weeks ago .
and i 'm exactly like that , i have to look at this , i have to look at this , or i 'm going to look at the case so trust that , i 'm going to go to the top .
and how do you do it , you know , on the mountain , you 're in the top ?
well , i mean , of course , i had the most incredible benefit , i do n't know , if it was to give me a hundred feet next to me .
and then i was going to be that rather <unk> .
now , can be the advantage , then fear is no problem .
and i also had to work again with the crux of art , now regardless of the <unk> bin , i <unk> , and i do n't even have <unk> <unk> , or done in berlin .
this is already <unk> , if you 're standing up and down the car , you have n't even see a lot to know where , you have to know , and it hurts when i <unk> .
and these things are always interesting for me .
now , to have the sophistication , but to know , hey , i 'm going to look at the war , so i want to focus on it , but it can be a new new experience .
and that 's exactly what the <unk> of it is <unk> , because at <unk> and <unk> <unk> , it 's just going to be 10 hours ,
you go and go away , and it 's just rocks around , and you 're still getting less plants .
you take a <unk> <unk> , <unk> gun , you know , the first world war in front of it .
so when you look at declassified , the most part of the last , the <unk> .
and so the point of the point is that the only exciting thing .
we just looked out of the distance or the other .
so i 'm standing there from why i trust <unk> , in the <unk> , despite his strange <unk> that he had .
because i thought , `` well , i 'll probably get faster than that the thing .
but , as i said , it 's pretty <unk> , because you do n't think about yourself a lot of change now .
and it becomes really exciting , it 's something difficult .
so if you put it into the height and the air is thinner .
or if it 's next to a <unk> , when you put <unk> little <unk> , where it 's left and on the right .
and then it 's particularly beautiful , and if it 's still at night , and all of these things with <unk> <unk> <unk> , then we can also have said goodbye , so he would have to be able to take a rope in the grasp .
because i was being <unk> than the one without <unk> .
trust , we 've created this , that i 'm going to have said , well , i can , of course , my favorite , my girlfriend , a hundred percent trust .
but i also also <unk> the same way that i 'm not going to focus on , because , can you imagine if you go to the mountain , you 're standing on the right on the right on the right on the right , right on the right , right on the right on the right , on the right on the right on the right , on the right on the right , on the right on the right , on the right on 11 .
it 's where you 're going to be in front of them , and that 's all .
so for us , we have faith in the case , and we 're looking for <unk> connection , so we put a rope in your backpack , that was what i had to do , and i had to go behind her in the <unk> .
in the other hand , in the other hand , <unk> <unk> , that i was also interested in the height of the stairs .
and she 's just showing out with the foot <unk> , and he <unk> <unk> , or she 's <unk> rock rock <unk> , that i did n't know what that was happening on me and me .
and what i really have shown is , how good it is , when you notice , of course , the summit you 're going to do is that you 're really going to have this sort of goal back to a way -- just as well as well as a <unk> , with the <unk> brothers .
on the other hand , it 's also that i have noticed that trust is that i have to trust that , and when i really have a really forgotten , it 's because of the peak .
but the trust trust is the trust of others , as trust it works .
when we 're in the mountain night , we were in the group of most of the time , and behind the other day behind us , and the other people had gone seven , and they 're quite relatively dense behind us , and i think , `` well , why else 's why else , because why am all of all of us ?
and at night , you ca n't look at the church of the back .
that is not the reason .
and then i realized , `` oh , yeah , yeah , sure you have trust your trust in their skills , and at some point , ''
you go to the dark , you go to 12 o'clock watch , then you do n't have light .
this is totally designed , if you 're <unk> , the air will fall up , so you 're actually going to have a <unk> , and now there 's no more frustrating .
and then , at some point , the moment you have said , yes , that was totally easy to go behind you , because the friend of me have to explain me , we 've always had the same thing -- how the women are doing this .
have the whole night telling us something , and the other thing in the group had just been there , right , okay , well , it 's just a <unk> hour , okay , so it 's only <unk> , and that 's what she tells me .
or i 've got her something else from the mountain .
and just to know that , it 's anybody here , but it 's still <unk> hour , the sun 's coming in .
and these things , this stuff can also increase its way from the outside , and it can contribute that you can actually get the personal stuff .
and for me , trust is , you know , it 's perfect , if you look at your personal opera , and that 's what they want to do , then , in the best , right there .
so that 's basically clear , in sports with the gold that you <unk> -- do n't i know why this is going to be -- maybe , i do n't know why this -- maybe , i do n't know why the value of the value is -- maybe , i do n't know , to test the value of the value ?
so , in some senses , it 's like , as the vancouver is six grams a lot .
if all of this is real gold , i do n't know , i would be on the <unk> , i swear .
or at least in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
but as i said , i mean , this is the real thing that you can imagine is that you can think , well , what did i have to do , and how i 'm really creating my skills , and how do i get my skills , and how do i get my skills , and how i 'm going to get my skills , and i focused on a period .
i mean , i 'm in my capability , but of course , in the team that we all need to do , anyway , whether in the training , in the job , in the day , in whatever .
do n't matter whether or young woman , we need people to trust , too .
and if we then have this goal in mind , and that 's the best proof that we can trust in our lives .
and if you can even do it again , you can still be able to be able to be able to play it in other areas .
thank you very much .
now , a science for me , this is the title of my talks , came to <unk> its beautiful maps .
what i 'm driving is that the very <unk> of the sciences again , the sciences again as a <unk> in the general population .
in essence , i could be satisfied .
when i 'm in an online <unk> , there 's all of scientific issues that are <unk> <unk> .
so even each of each step has a range of <unk> <unk> newspapers , magazines , <unk> , where scientific things , <unk> issues , somehow understandable .
now , every station has at least a <unk> , where kind of scientific stuff .
even , this is totally <unk> , when you look at what 's going on with magazines and <unk> for kids with scientific issues .
every program has a little bit at the <unk> list , but yet it 's such a pure <unk> story .
science is one thing that i can like to look at , that i can love to read , but i do n't like that , but i do n't like that .
cool , well , is something that 's only in a sense of self-awareness , with low bad , somewhere , there 's a bad cool , <unk> ?
if you have a $ five minutes , at least nothing to do with reality , but that 's cool , <unk> ?
there , i can identify myself .
big bang , because i can laugh on it , i do n't understand the jokes , but it 's great .
that 's extremely bad .
because , that 's kind of a paradox that the future of the future is , we can only deal with such technology and things .
but at the same time , they did n't care about it .
so i have a couple of little examples of how science or science just so on us .
now , a very cool example , in london , you 've made a nice tower , <unk> , the architect of the architect , even not that , we 're going to sort of crashed it .
what 's happening is that the sun comes from the sun in this facade , and i have <unk> , and then somewhere else in the other hand at a point .
and that was big through the press , and that 's where there was a seat .
so , bad , the heat has so upset that this poor <unk> , which was really long , long ago , because there 's the <unk> .
and you ask , you know , this architect like a architect , not actually , just as a little bit of physics , because i mean , it 's totally new , that 's what it 's about .
so , what i found is very new , <unk> , sort of , <unk> , where he was supposedly with radiation to radiation .
now , i really wonder what has the more design or architect or where did he have studied ?
now this is a very frustrating example .
one of the most interesting things have these current issues , is also the same thing .
<unk> , this is a couple of years ago , when it came to the media .
and that was the move , because the <unk> changed , that was one danger .
and the genes was common with green <unk> .
genes were kind of a bit of literal .
oh , oh , there are the genes inside .
there was moments where in the market farmers have gotten really gotten : hey , i have <unk> vegetables .
no idea what this is supposed to be .
so yes , okay , <unk> tomatoes , we can discuss it .
but at the time i was involved in the lab , and i totally realized totally ago because i tried to have these evil genes in my bacteria , these <unk> <unk> .
and was totally frustrated , came home , and my fellow neighbor : `` <unk> , you ai n't happy , what 's going on ?
i mean , yes , i 've been able to transform a small gene in my bacteria , and that does n't work .
that was what i tried to explain to explain , so somehow a <unk> , the genes , i thought , yes , my good lady , when i talk about genes , you know what it means .
that was what i was really meant , so this particular sequence i wanted to put in this <unk> .
but that was what the woman actually has .
i never have the same hand again .
who knows what i 'm say'n , <unk> ?
genes is a very bad thing .
this is now a lot of time now , and yet it has kind of sense in consciousness .
genes , that 's what makes matter .
<unk> , i 've also read about it .
it 's getting the gene , and there 's really really in our language .
<unk> is bound to europe , was a headline .
it 's considerably considerably of other corn that 's not the genes .
one other headline , <unk> , rats are going to die in rats .
yes , that was a beautiful slogan .
but they 're not that old , and it 's also pretty much anyway , on which level i 'm going to make sense .
do n't matter whether the time or the image , all talking about <unk> .
luckily , it 's not <unk> <unk> , but i 'm afraid it 's not a long time .
but it turns out that the uncertainty of the population is in the population , because they 're just not interested in the themes .
nevertheless , we have to employ ourselves in our future future .
now , just <unk> , nobody had the big end on the topic , but it 's about stuff and it 's most of what most of the most people do n't know .
and that 's pretty sad .
now , how come to the population in the population ?
when we think of this little boy , some of our scientist is happening in his lab , an experiment starter something like beautiful and good , and he thinks , gee , that 's what he 's doing is the public .
and then you have to go to a professor .
the head decides you 're going to say , well , is cool subject to his name , and it 's always important in science , <unk> .
good idea , i 'm still not in the public , it 's about a <unk> .
yes , the <unk> sense , oh , great idea , the class , because there 's a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there 's a <unk> with a project , a beautiful idea , and that 's kind of stuff out of that .
so this is going to be <unk> , yes , but who are actually ?
now these days are barely alone , if they 're not alone , there are some <unk> such a common <unk> , a common <unk> .
and from all these things , the <unk> , the really exciting projects , will then be over the <unk> of the magazine , the <unk> , no matter , <unk> or <unk> .
that 's the way .
from the foundation , you 're going to continue to go on , in the base up to the really , really cool experiments that really works what 's going on .
so , that 's good news magazine , who are really good , right ?
and basically , it 's basically just that matter .
in the '50s community , we call this `` the <unk> <unk> . ''
so that 's what you 're interested in , the <unk> then then the newspaper , yes , fine and good .
beautiful magazine , the audience who care about , and who may care about it , and that may be about a single idea , where it 's at all this strange .
who are i really doing ?
the <unk> rowers , that 's true .
well , that 's what 's called the editor , i call him mr. <unk> <unk> , who read the way i do n't really .
still , again , our future , we 'll only be able to do somehow , if we 're dealing with these neurotransmitters .
fracking , <unk> , renewable energy , <unk> , these are all sorts of things that are <unk> , but not really understand , and that he should be .
my project , my idea is that , different , those little , young , healthy scientists get out out of the boat , really completely from his regular <unk> , and he gives you a course .
so what happens most of it is that a scientist , i have a buddy , and we had a <unk> , and we 've been told for a good 20 years , it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> , it 's a <unk> rule to his profession .
once he tells his mouth and talk about his job , he has <unk> us .
<unk> , these are scientists who are telling you what 's going on .
<unk> , you hear a lot , <unk> , <unk> , which is almost as same as genes .
it 's treated , you know , oh , you do n't know what 's behind .
so , you know , it 's beautiful and good , if you 're on a meeting and your people , your <unk> , your way , your <unk> , your <unk> , you can tell you about <unk> , but still , you know , i just want water to it .
where is the problem , it really stops and ordinary ?
so i was high school , that 's my idea , these young scientists , who are n't as far as far in the hierarchy , which are some more malleable to me how to be honest .
this has a benefit , <unk> , like investors , who want to know what 's happening in the <unk> .
and finally , this is also <unk> that used to be used as well , so that 's actually going to communicate the climate language .
but this training , that 's just a story .
i want to put you to a week , and you should imagine your project , your project 's project , some <unk> , honest , but worse .
there 's a quote , i do n't know if the real thing is , by albert <unk> , if you ca n't explain , you did n't really understand it .
so the scientists of the laboratory come out of the lab , and your project really has to rethink , how can i communicate this way to communicate ?
so , there 's lots of stuff already .
<unk> are totally modern , everywhere , in every university , <unk> , but also , in the way , i just returned to the <unk> .
who 's driving for the <unk> end of the city in the university of some of the university in the university of a lecture ?
these are the ones who care
that 's what i 'm doing again .
so , these are the people who have allowed to do this , and you can hear a bunch of things out there .
that 's beautiful , because there 's some <unk> , all of you are happy , they 're happy , and that 's it .
so i 'm announcing on a second point , and say , it 's not in the project .
and these scientists are still going to have to have been able to have a lot , how do they have kids ?
because a lot of them have really allowed to reduce the difference in the world .
because scientists , like exploring , and how children are exploring their world is the same .
children are really quite interested at work .
they 're doing something like this .
they 're saying what does work ?
<unk> , fall outside , does n't work , the next repetition , i change a couple of points , i think it 's new .
children learn extremely <unk> .
these are really <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , i <unk> what 's going on , which can change what i think is that it works .
that 's normal !
but that 's many .
and from that , i think , really , really work , if after that , you know , when after that , you know , when after that , you know , and these scientists grow in the neighborhood , in the environment with the children of the kindergarten , from the schools , in the environment , with the kids from kindergarten , from the schools , in these experiments , the kids , the children , and the scientists are actually doing the same language .
and then you can , maybe somewhere , this is such my hope , tell the kids , and then i also get some hate <unk> , which then then , for scientific issues , because the children told him this .
that 's not somewhere in the newspaper , that 's not somewhere in galileo , but his kids tell him something that it has <unk> in paper , and then you can see and shake your head as a architect like this house .
and not only , i mean , it 's great <unk> , but also the <unk> .
that 's my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately , it 's just happening that the first <unk> that i call painted , yes , <unk> for our scientists , that 's just not subject , which is just a different priorities .
a scientist do n't have to communicate .
yes , i think , okay , let me call the next .
but who somehow work in a center program , it 's a company in a company , as well , that 's the next moment .
thank you very much .
i 'm assuming , is the question .
you can fly every day .
the last couple of weeks were terrible .
weather has made us a big hit through the calculation .
seven years ago , i was asked to ask if i want to take it here .
i was the ceo of it , almost 10 years , at the <unk> <unk> in munich and in <unk> .
we 've come up to the top .
had <unk> than customer .
and for me , that was really , well , that 's <unk> .
so what should this happen ?
<unk> , that 's ridiculous .
but i 've learned who behind it , and i 'm here today .
and yeah , it 's a little bit crazy , but it 's also very emotional .
it 's beautiful and it 's exciting , and it 's exciting .
and i 'm just going to take you to the next round of <unk> minutes a little bit from this life of a <unk> .
i 'm an indian <unk> .
there 's been a hundred and <unk> years .
i 'm the director of the <unk> .
this company is over 20 years .
and ceos of the <unk> .
the company has been about <unk> or <unk> .
the <unk> here is the zeppelin .
seven .
this is a picture i want to show you , the little point is right , this is actually a red , or anything , it does n't know , it 's too big .
there 's just <unk> <unk> .
and it 's actually only a decade of active .
that 's what happens .
there 's about 20 thousand acres of active world .
so this is no market .
that 's not even a <unk> .
this is a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is , why do you actually do that ?
so , how about this ?
<unk> in the war and only 10 , because we can talk about why this is .
very quickly .
<unk> is one of many <unk> <unk> <unk> .
all the time
it 's got the first world bank before the first world war in the world war ii .
then in the first world war , <unk> <unk> died , by the way , the <unk> and <unk> , were <unk> <unk> .
and then they have london and so on and so forth .
and when we came up and eight to london , and with a large <unk> place , there was a <unk> campaign full of the headline that was <unk> with the christian slogan : that , you get it , but it 's not with bombs , but it 's peaceful intention .
and so the story has <unk> .
and we had an issue campaign .
but <unk> , the customer , was n't so much more comfortable , because he had always gotten clear to what 's behind what your memories was there .
and , you know , that was a little bit more bad for the people .
but anyway , it was a good app in london , except the weather in the north was a very bad and very <unk> .
and we 're not quite <unk> .
then , <unk> 20 , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it has a <unk> ceremony that was going to go to america .
this has felt a myth that the whole german nation has felt something when he was <unk> and <unk> .
it was being in new york with <unk> units .
and the whole german nation is <unk> , we 're back to who .
this is what 's happening inside , and this is really what explains a little bit of this myth from this device .
but in fact , then you 're actually built up to the <unk> , and then only five , six , six , seven <unk> were still built , and only two is big , the most youthful waves and the ones that have completed the passengers .
burnham , a hundred , where about <unk> passengers and <unk> were at the end .
but it was a myth .
and the <unk> then , then the first stage was <unk> , the first live crash , but that 's what he said yes .
next to the titanic , where a icon , a product is a product , and then never again .
and the other vehicles also hired .
and <unk> , <unk> the last few of the world 's heart attack .
the materials used to be used for <unk> , <unk> , the hidden air .
it was a long time ago .
and then the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , and the zeppelin that had the idea , maybe one should start again .
and i was hired <unk> , because you have a great product in the way , but we 'll get a look at it , but the market .
yes , is it a market at all ?
so what is there ?
here .
we 're talking about now .
the <unk> <unk> , it may be just a little bit of time , and we do n't care about it .
there are many companies that came out of this category .
it 's now <unk> employee , about 20 billion .
that 's a really right demographic , high fuel oil .
there 's a lot of this .
and then i 'm convinced with me here .
the zeppelin in itself is a very ordinary plane like any other plane , but it 's sorry , it has a gas , not hydrogen , and also a <unk> .
it 's like a whale , in the water and under dirt , and it has to be done .
the time is now not to explain that in detail .
in the inside , there 's a big look like this with a structure .
there are two main types of <unk> .
there are certain <unk> , which is what we 're <unk> in and <unk> .
they do n't have structure in the structure , and they 're like <unk> in <unk> .
these are most of the <unk> that have been built in the world , about shark , higher pieces .
and of course , there 's only today that i said earlier , only <unk> in the war , minus our own existence , so it 's about 20 .
this is what it looks like is the production of the air is placed .
on the left , the structure is still again .
and also the shell is also <unk> .
come from the <unk> .
tr : the <unk> of the astronauts .
<unk> then there are the origins .
costs two million dollars a shell .
and it 's got to be <unk> , have to be <unk> , and it has to be <unk> , because whenever you want a band-aid in it , or a hole that it can not continue .
and you do n't think about the <unk> again , and look at exactly if it 's controlled in the light .
and at the end of the end , a little bit like this is a little bit like the speed of what it is .
so the zeppelin is technically .
and this is what you see here in the numbers , very quickly .
one point nine percent , one point nine percent , one point for six four percent <unk> , which is about thousands of thousand visits a year .
that 's very little and very good .
that 's a <unk> .
that can see .
but there 's one other trend that makes us care about now , and that 's what i show up here .
we had two years ago , when i started to start with <unk> five , eight years ago , <unk> percent <unk> , and last year , <unk> percent <unk> .
and this year , we were at <unk> percent .
if you want eight years , my eight years , when you want to get away , you can say , at least in this eight , of course , a <unk> of the <unk> , the weather has changed for us .
we 're <unk> .
we ca n't fly through mist .
you want to see something .
and the <unk> or <unk> , actually , every year .
so , a little image that our weather is not only only , but also statistically , because we 're making weather weather every day .
but because this is , now , the european union has a program in a program , almost ten million dollars , and we 're a natural part of this program .
i just come from finland now for finland .
this is <unk> here .
<unk> is called the campaign .
and we 're <unk> <unk> in the <unk> between the surface and <unk> .
it 's called the <unk> <unk> .
and the zeppelin t is from italy to <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
many of many of a lot of a hundred and a half of a hundred <unk> tissues , and the way they analyzed the air as they respond to our things that we are in the ground .
there , i just explains , there 's where we 're on the second stage .
a great commission .
and it 's when you look like this is the way you want to look like this .
so this is very good .
and here 's a couple more <unk> .
that 's what sweden is last week or <unk> week .
and in finland , the weather is great , <unk> degrees , <unk> degrees , 30 degrees .
the <unk> people say this was never .
i 've had wonderful , beautiful french days .
the mosquitos were not so bad .
we were also in africa .
and for de <unk> , as a <unk> , they were able to look at the <unk> , the burning are over <unk> by millions .
but you can also ask yourself , this is all africa , that 's a little bit more like you ask for meaning , after a idea , to make sense of questions in the theater , the movie `` <unk> '' is .
so i asked myself , well , what do we do ?
and what do we do that ?
at the end , we were done after two years .
the <unk> then did n't go .
the whole family came in and the project was finished .
and a tornado won the <unk> , at the end of the gold then , then that he could stay in the corner .
but not so bad .
we had some good insurance , and we were really excited .
that was the prototype .
and i did n't know what to do with it .
yes , what we 're doing today is a very quick <unk> from the <unk> .
what we 're doing today , it 's just about complexity , it 's about questions , growth , growth .
what we 're doing today is the <unk> here in <unk> .
of course we do .
we have to keep the zeppelin .
<unk> is the aging .
and there 's still a little bit of devices , after 10 , nine times you have to be replaced .
we 're just replacing the total energy model for five million dollars .
there 's a customer that 's where we 're talking about .
we do , we have to keep the internet trees .
we 're a <unk> <unk> , which is the german <unk> , and from the european government , and the way that it 's being controlled with the <unk> and the way it is like <unk> like <unk> and <unk> .
this is also <unk> and costs money , and it 's still going to be getting together .
the question is , do you continue ?
do you want to evolve ?
do you get bigger <unk> ?
there 's <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
so what do you do ?
do you move on the market ?
do you keep on the menu ?
and so , of course , in my time , in my time .
and we have some <unk> hatch .
and by the way , the <unk> of some <unk> of <unk> , has been <unk> .
at the beginning of the <unk> , the donation of <unk> .
the population of the german population has saved him with six million subscribers than a donation , when the fourth was <unk> , and he was broke , the citizens told him a donation .
and it 's at all of the sudden waves , and the other companies , as we were able to do , or maybe other companies would n't be there .
we were in tokyo , <unk> .
we were , and they 'd listen to the past , in san francisco with a customer .
there was a very <unk> <unk> .
both of those projects failed .
so also <unk> .
at the same time , we won <unk> .
i do n't have a picture because we can not show the <unk> .
but in america , now , in america , the <unk> of the first <unk> in the finished .
we sold three pieces .
with <unk> , we undertake a mate with a mate with a mate .
and that 's a big deal , but at the same time , in the same time .
two customers are basically <unk> because it did n't .
why did n't it ?
we actually know it already .
either , the location was not the right or the passengers to go to the speed of the passengers , or in america you had to know the last 30 century , the advertising did .
these people have <unk> , have seen this in the field , have said , `` <unk> , '' again , again , again , a <unk> , who makes an <unk> .
there 's no way that you can do n't know .
and it was actually twice so much difficult in marketing , `` hey , guys , '' and <unk> .
<unk> is good .
the pilot in the year , transport , holocaust <unk> , <unk> passengers .
but last year , we have only been <unk> from weather .
there 's a couple of a million .
that 's bad .
the zeppelin 's <unk> <unk> <unk> .
it 's the sense of course , of course , if i look at it as ceos , you see the passengers and you 're not going to do an ad , because it 's mouth to mouth , and the people say , that 's nice , and i do n't recommend your friends , and you know , you know , that 's nice , and then on the family .
and we 're great .
and while again , i 'm going to think of the mistake that we think we 're <unk> .
you could be more able to pull over .
we have a <unk> on the <unk> and we 're <unk> .
that 's not true .
we also do advertising .
that 's one more art that has been obsolete .
and it turns out this has done this with the island of a video game .
but the <unk> is a difficult market .
and you 've got to ask the problem , do n't make sense ?
we actually have enough marketing ads , but internet has changed a lot of changes in the start , because they control everything .
the <unk> is largely <unk> , which is why there 's only 10 active in the world today .
we have three here .
two active , one , <unk> , the <unk> , three has <unk> , 10 are active .
so , six of 10 .
that is what we 're going to do is that we 're actually going to control the marketplace if it 's at least .
and hope to make a future again .
and what at the end david scott , commander of apollo ii , after his <unk> paris and five , he said , `` the walk on the walk . ''
so <unk> is beautiful .
we do n't think about advertising .
we do n't find any customers .
now , let 's get great , have a technological value .
we have customer .
that 's not uncommon .
it 's <unk> , it goes on and off .
this is a $ 100 dollar system to get that .
and then there 's a lot of years .
there 's a curious effect that are very difficult to control .
in any case , this is the situation , <unk> , a point in the world , so it 's no market .
but we 're going to go further .
it 's a icon of the region .
the <unk> people have the power to do it .
and you 're just asking the question : where are we going to continue ?
how much money do we spend in the world ?
what do we do for here ?
so what 's going on ?
and i personally , you 've asked me to say something personal , i 'm , of course , next to my fellow <unk> , where i wanted to have <unk> <unk> , where i wanted to have <unk> <unk> at the time , where i wanted to go through <unk> <unk> , where i wanted to go through <unk> <unk> , where i wanted to go through <unk> <unk> , where i wanted to step out , where i wanted to get <unk> dead , where i wanted to get <unk> dead , where i want to get <unk> dead , where i want to get <unk> dead , where i want to go to the
i was also traveling in greenpeace three years , when i went through studying island , and this whole <unk> of the reef have been able to see me that i made that thing .
and then there was a series of greenpeace talking about greenpeace who are distressed in the money , not knowing what they should be , and they 're almost gone .
and that 's where they spoke to me all the way .
and i 'm doing three years earlier , as a <unk> , and now i 'm doing this in the hope to reach a long future .
zero , right ? neuroscientist seconds , i 'm ready , thank you .
<unk> .
yes , thank you very much .
these are my three points that i want to talk to the <unk> .
why are we today in the subject or abundance ?
how do we get to the <unk> ?
and most importantly , what ?
what is this ?
let 's start with our first point .
the first one is maybe a little bit .
but it 's also beginning to show the challenges .
a couple of years ago , this is still a difficult thing to explain that .
that we have a problem today , every child .
we have environmental problems .
but it 's always worth that again , that 's the challenges that the challenges , the population growth for example .
all sorts of data spreads exponentially .
if you look at it in a new long term , the bottom line , for example , that 's a very short episode in history .
we can not imagine that it 's kind of different than that it 's going to go forward .
you know climate change that last century of years .
some people say , well , in the past , the last four years ago .
you can also look at this as well , i 'm also right .
you can also say who needs ?
you can also say that the ocean is far away .
but it 's all about that , if you 're going to engage a little bit closer to do things like this , to avoid things that really is , you know , we just have trouble with the <unk> of health .
<unk> is about 30 degrees .
and there 's degrees for us to be in our cities like this in vienna , or <unk> , in a way , it 's all bad .
but it 's also about <unk> , especially in asia .
think about the himalayas , where the big streams , and the <unk> of these are going to be the <unk> of the water from the himalayas .
it 's not about the planet .
the planet is what we 're doing , there was a lot larger crisis .
and <unk> , but it 's about us to be living in a very hostile life .
it 's about loss of biodiversity .
the deserts industry itself .
it 's getting less and less .
that 's the aral sea , where it 's part of our cotton .
and all of that , where is that ?
all of these bad things , `` oh , '' i think , in the one hand , '' or another shape with global <unk> .
what we 're going to get from the earth , what we harvest .
not only , the oil and the speed and the <unk> , but also the renewables , the renewables are , but ultimately we do n't .
and we 're just going to see that we 're going to use so much as we use as much as we use , to produce less waste and emissions .
so it 's about this , in fact , it 's been used to reduce the world 's really dramatically .
that 's the challenge , not just climate , not just c is two , <unk> from a car to another but different .
different from the economies .
our technology is totally new .
if we even look back to the hunters and <unk> , and there 's still on the planet societies that are living in the principle of life , come on a ton economy in the year .
in a <unk> , it 's been in the longest era of human history , three tons tons .
today , it 's <unk> to <unk> .
so , of course , <unk> has this <unk> .
and it 's very , very <unk> distributed .
it 's over north america more than more than we have more than the earth .
and in other parts of the world , look at africa , very much less .
and it comes to us , we embrace the impact on us , the air is much better in the last decades of the world .
and the other parts of the world is still going to be less .
and that 's why the conflicts that we can see is from <unk> , is afghanistan , afghanistan , where you look at the <unk> of the american press , and you see where the raw materials come .
and that 's where there 's especially colorful , which is , there are lots of resources out there , where the <unk> of the world are .
so if we want to go to the drawing , we have to do it with the subject .
so we have to change , the ecological boundaries are all around the world 's population .
and that 's what we 've got to do with <unk> life is not yet that .
this has been the mahatma gandhi , when he said , the world has enough for everybody , but not for everybody .
and there we are , like we already live on average life .
here .
that was the kind of <unk> .
but i always think you have the need to understand what to change .
even if i would say , it 's worth as if i would say , it 's like to live different , which is more .
but it 's always coming out , from the <unk> , you know , you know , i 'm going to tell you , `` tell me . ''
so , what is it ?
and that 's what we have to do is that we have to be in our rich parts of the world that are so much , economically , in quality of life , in standard , but in some cases often ,
here 's a pretty good mood , but there are people , and you know , you know , people who are not so good to deal with this story .
i 've written it .
<unk> and climate change have the same amount .
we 're working too far and more empowered .
this is on a page , we 're at stress , and eventually it 's too much .
i also work very well .
and on the other hand , we 're just using this <unk> .
so what is a good life ?
so how can we define this ?
now comes up with a little bit of science reader .
well , what i 've said before , and what i 'm going to say about that , is it 's about this point , how can i define that way ?
and there 's important to understand that life has always been two aspects .
life has changed the issue of objective conditions as i 'm going to eat .
did i have a roof above the head ?
do i have friends ?
so i can play myself in life ?
but just too , how do i go to do with me how to go ?
i do n't know that 's the normal quality of life .
and then i 'm going to get two terms of the things that are important in the position .
that 's a needs .
the needs is the very fundamental dimension of our human development , and we 're about to study emotions .
if we can satisfy our needs , we 're happy .
you can not say , needs sustainable , sustainable or not sustainable .
we do n't want to talk to hackers .
what are needs ?
you can quote , `` many scientists , '' i just mentioned two .
and you see , of course , of course , the physical needs , but also need to security , to social relationships .
after protection , after <unk> , after <unk> , to spirituality , after freedom .
this has all to do with money .
but not a big part , but the question is how to look at my life .
and there i am in the second importance .
the strategies .
the strategy i 'm using is to meet this needs .
and there 's a lot of time that i can do with a high eye or with a low <unk> .
you can need a lot of money , or do n't need money .
strategies are my behavior as i 'm my needs .
that has to do with my values , with the resources , with the possibilities that i have .
when i have money , i 'm going to try to satisfy my needs when i have a lot of money on the car .
it 's all about the <unk> , which is the roof above the roof , and then you like to eat it .
and here 's what it can do with a lot or a little <unk> , that can be sustainable and <unk> .
and when we reach the whole strategies that i have to have to get to the needs to satisfy my needs , then we talk about a lifestyle .
here .
that was the kind of scientific <unk> .
and now we can now do something now ?
so , how about this ?
and there 's just a couple of evidence .
and of course , that 's what it needs to find itself for itself .
but the evidence of the individual , on a technological way , here 's what i 've talked about today , and also finally in the end of the political form .
what can we do ?
what can we do ?
what do we do ?
so where do we want to go ?
the slides at the beginning of the beginning , you have said , the danger is that we 're going to use more co2 consumption .
so for the end of the quality of life , the effects of the effects are getting worse , and it 's going to be worse , and it 's going to be going back to us .
or , if we can do it , if you 're going to go to a different direction , which , maybe consumption with a higher quality of life .
there 's one of my favorite devices , you might have heard him some , <unk> by <unk> that this topic , which is more quality of quality of life .
it 's a lot about technology as i can , every single thing we use the computer , the orange juice , how do i make it so ?
it can be a way that i can build the house out of wood , etc .
to create a lot less more likely to produce more efficiently .
my other teachers , <unk> <unk> has this , the <unk> , the <unk> , and then we 're at what today has been already already already , because it 's going to look at the very deep way .
so where are the needs ?
what kind of services can i have ?
and how do i do that with a little more frustrating ?
and it 's not with a little less but with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> percent less .
there 's lots of examples that can happen .
in vienna , a tower would be built into a tower with 20 <unk> .
with seven <unk> , it 's built in <unk> .
that 's basically made of lumber .
you know , if you can not take anymore , and then you 're going back to your corner , and not so much much less resources with everything else , you 're going to have a lot less resource in the house , and you 're going to have a lot of resources in the house at the beginning of the house , and you 're going to do it with a fifth of the house , across the whole lifetime of the house , with that one percent of the house .
but it 's also a lot of it in our own , like , how do i really have myself ?
<unk> <unk> has written a great book , <unk> .
where he shows how hard it is so hard to get from from the way from this point .
the <unk> , i want to come to the other hand , and then i 'm in this race .
you 've got to have the same reaction that i took you , and then i get the new .
and the most beautiful , i 'm wearing the <unk> , you know .
when i started my institute a few years ago , we wrote writing .
and then you 've got to wait until the letter , you know , you 're saying , is <unk> <unk> .
that 's what i write hundreds of emails .
and i can do a lot more .
that 's productivity , which is economic growth , we 're coming in .
but i did n't really have huge .
i did n't have to do that .
there 's good examples , slow food , for example , where i really want to do the urge to the quality and the desire to the auditorium in the foreground .
and with a very small cost of quality of life .
one of my favorites is <unk> .
there 's some time today , you 've heard that , in fact , the average person in germany , in germany , about tens of thousands of foreign things .
you can start to count them .
who was two , three generations of things , had employees , personal .
they 've done that .
we have to deal with it .
and as much people get this clear with these kinds of options .
and you need a <unk> that helps us in helping us with these few things .
if you look at what i 'm interesting is , maybe it 's also a lot of the spaceship , this is what i am , do n't have any juvenile stuff .
the next example , the next example .
a true boom .
star , <unk> , <unk> , maybe 20 years ago , 20 years ago .
in the meantime , they 're used more and more people when they 're thinking .
if you think about <unk> .
coral reefs , working together , they work out how to do the things that we 've got to do , and that we 've got this beautiful <unk> here , which is still going to be a few hundred years ago , and yet , on the other centuries , this is the last end .
so that 's just a systematic way to use it .
that 's the last part of justice .
so i had shown you , as a result , that 's what i think is as a picture of africa and europe and a better world .
so , in fact , all the same at the same time with these resources are only possible if we do n't use less .
and it 's not less quality of life , because many of us already have a lot of us .
but it 's a major problem of the economy , the company , the products , the services really , the services really is to make us a good life with a lot less resource .
last aspect , this has something to do with the major politics after growth , <unk> , i think it .
if you 're reading a little bit about the projections , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it 's over oecd , <unk> , now the next week to the bottom .
it means , yes , a crisis is , in my mind , the door after my view , what we 've talked about , and the numbers of what we 've talked about , you know , that 's essentially for all of the countries going forward .
and there 's no reason again , as i am from my youth , from the 1930s .
part of it has particularly interesting reasons .
one point five percent growth is so much as eight percent growth .
and the eight percent is what china has today .
they are also about here , where we were in a few years ago .
in all , if the pie is bigger , of course , is eight percent .
it 's still a lot of it , so we 're going to be good .
but you have to hire it up on it , that means , not even if we had zero percent growth , that means that , in the next year , they have exactly as much producing and consume and income like in this year .
we can do so well , and we can be working .
that 's why it 's also not so wrong , because you know that statistics , that the growth of the growth is not going to be long-lasting .
the economy grows , but the quality of life stays in the state of the state that we are .
and by the way , also , also , jobs , and by the way , it 's also possible for growth , and it 's not going to be so intimately , like us and how they 're all siblings .
that 's just not true , and then you have to look at the economics .
and it 's still getting back and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more like the line or the other week , or next week , i 'm going to start in the trend , a bigger story to this topic .
in fact , edward <unk> , who <unk> the nobel prize in his <unk> <unk> that he said , `` the good life , the good economy , the good life . ''
that 's why the last thing is , and not to create not primarily to create the growth , not primarily to create growth , not primarily to do growth for our countries .
for sure and such countries , for china , for india , is the rest of the rest of other story .
and that 's going to happen , and when we grow there , we 're just going to grow on this stage , on this very high level , where we 're good at life and economies .
it also needs to be politics .
it takes action .
it takes some clues to say the economists .
it does n't just affect the growth , but we really have to look at it and measure and measurable and ask , how do we have the quality of life , is that ?
is the peak ?
after that , our politicians are measurable .
of course , how much is the <unk> ?
so what do you think ?
we need an essence of that , and we finally need to make the <unk> and not the work .
you know , you know , you know , you know , the entrepreneur among them , but also the people , you know .
so , what 's going on with taxes , we have paid for a colleague .
you could do something different .
the resources are much reduced , and therefore are the resource resources and not the work .
and you 've got to be able to do all of the last century to create jobs to secure employment , health , infrastructure .
that 's all right , but there 's a little bit hard .
that means that , of course , more or less , on every levels can be built into this way , we can actually engage , we can have the right products , services than consumers are , what do we need to do that , how do we need the right products ?
what do we need and what do n't we need ?
the real politics we want to do is we have to set forward .
some evidence .
and so , of course , the science percent of all the world is still going on , how can we stimulate the growth growth ?
but sadly , nobody did .
if you look at the projections of the last 20 years , it 's going to go to the bottom .
the policy is not going to create growth , but that 's the question we 're going to do with that , and that 's what we have a good life of it ?
so , you know , they 're doing it .
you want the <unk> you go to the lake .
with heart , brain , hand and the last , again , we need to need the <unk> .
thank you very much .
i 'm <unk> <unk> .
and i love this city .
and this city has so many stories .
one of those has happened a few hundred years ago .
and it has to do with creative problem-solving .
now , i get in this creative problem , and i 'll tell you a story .
it 's going to do with the fortress .
this is the <unk> here in the middle of this town , and a lot of that city also is , as a result .
another story .
it was hot in <unk> , nevada .
and a man notice , like , in his shoes , it 's really <unk> .
it 's too warm .
he 's europeans , he knows that .
he does it , he pulls the shoe of it , and it 's not quite a long place in a long way , and it 's a lot of holes in a lot of holes there .
and he pulls the shoe back to it , and he 's got a new climate in the shoe .
it 's the shoe , the obvious , born .
and this number , which you see here is the place in the genesis of the <unk> <unk> today .
a company is <unk> , with four letters .
the one or another one of you know .
he changed the original idea to be <unk> and <unk> .
they both have sex .
so he says , well , <unk> , i make my own business .
<unk> is about the stock market .
right now , a thousand korean workers in the base of a thousand employees , in fact , a thousand employees , in fact , a thousand employees , in fact , a thousand employees over the world .
that 's a much more creative problem .
why not make something new , what do n't it ?
and mobility , maybe the question was going to be <unk> .
if you do n't know anything , it 's for what 's a chance ?
and that 's a question that i 've often helped me with a lot of time .
if something wrong happened , or my collaborator , i do n't work or technology or technology .
little memory , little memory , <unk> .
what is the opportunity ?
and you get from the <unk> menu .
so , what this can do is i 'm here with this example here .
and one of the examples of the <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> statements of <unk> .
and the proof of how creative people can be , when it comes to your own insurance .
so let me show you some examples here .
so these are actually so restricted to the <unk> era , and it 's also done an ad .
i 'm <unk> ' .
my son did n't <unk> .
it 's just <unk> ; it 's the wife through the <unk> .
or i had the whole day of justice , when i reached the corner , suddenly a <unk> in my heart and i could n't see the other car .
clearly , who 's up to be obvious , right ?
the bush .
<unk> are <unk> .
i 've been <unk> , and two times almost died .
and you can think of it at least half of your hand .
the last thing i did was not to be a <unk> .
it was a young woman in the <unk> .
if you 're a man , every one explanation ...
but if you 're a woman , you do n't understand it .
so people are creative , we are creative .
and i wish to me , and i want to employ that we 're all using the creativity .
a lot of us are in a <unk> <unk> .
and it does n't have to be that way .
why not do things just different ?
old things that we 're going to do that we may have to do , or foresight , than the opposite .
why do n't just do it differently , it 's a little bit like little simple <unk> .
and there 's something like this companies that are using this .
for example , this is what you have <unk> , you know , you 've put these <unk> of their homes , these signs , or on the wall for instance , and there may be something like that .
one way , right ?
let 's just stay with coffee instead of the coffee .
or that .
we do n't have a draft , <unk> you .
is it already today today , right ?
if you ca n't type the mobile phone box .
or , you know , you 'll fall together .
sorry , but creative .
that 's what it takes .
i 'll give you one of the clients or the people who would go into and say , well , that 's like me .
i said , `` well , that 's what i said .
a <unk> <unk> has the current <unk> <unk> , which is in <unk> .
once again , the present news , even more politics .
if you had three on the square , you 've been <unk> .
once the complaint took over to a long period of time ago .
it 's a <unk> building , and the restaurant had a small , so he had all of the chefs to do .
it was too deeply .
they think , in common , what do we do ?
how do we solve the problem ?
we ca n't get faster faster .
here 's an idea .
on each image , a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> salt , pepper and a <unk> .
that 's the case that you could have ever been able to eat the <unk> themselves themselves .
just so different .
a creative idea , and maybe it 's been solved .
there 's one person who 's not popular .
this person is the leader of <unk> , so the <unk> of the <unk> .
and we 're now <unk> the german side .
the second day , this is still going on , so four days .
there 's a company called <unk> <unk> to the collaborator of month , and you might know that .
it 's a <unk> , you know , well , we thank you .
people are going to face out of the face .
the buses are full of them , it 's going to run <unk> , people , in order to talk to people , because of course , to others for others to get a to b .
but why do n't even have something practical and creative from his disadvantage ?
sometimes there 's also creativity also happen .
and it 's coming from an affliction , like this company , you might know .
so we know that it 's not really good , but that it 's something that they have to be saving in the finance community .
or the <unk> in the car .
now we know the different , <unk> , and all sorts of directions .
yes .
why not a piece of download your car on the car , if you 're <unk> ?
or in <unk> , it 's also ways to make creative .
and all of this has just to do with humor , with joy , and sometimes it 's dumb , <unk> ?
sometimes it 's funny .
one of my favorite son , i was in the office .
and it 's sitting on that <unk> .
so , we 've got several <unk> around around the screen .
and then it turns out of the left to the right , he 's up , and i 'm saying , `` well , that 's not a playground . ''
he was looking at me , big eyes , playground .
and in the moment , what i did is he was right , right ?
why is n't that a playground ?
why is what we do n't , not the playground for adults ?
now , what about it a lot more , right ?
if we 're in perspective , if we use our talents , that 's what we like to do .
and it 's <unk> , but it 's really comfortable .
now , the argument that it is , when a particular day comes out of the week , that 's what your brain changes .
it 's the first day in the week , and somehow our focus on one another day .
that 's one other day , we have a lot better .
that 's how it weekend .
you know , you hear that , you know , too .
i mean , it 's a day to the weekend .
or if the most beautiful age of the year 's year , the vacation officer .
so what are the rest of the last five weeks ?
is it that awful ?
are we all such awful jobs ?
a <unk> had had on top page , this issue .
yes , monday , and the rest of them are asking .
or on giant grass , on facebook , anywhere in social networks will be settled .
and then i went through the <unk> , one of the <unk> in <unk> .
there 's a lot of business , and i want to look at me .
what do you think of that , what else is there ?
and one day i would like to buy this business with this car .
and the first sign you can see here , yeah , that 's pretty good .
so , of course , i love to work with love .
i 'm also doing that , my five kids , but i love my work .
yes .
or still <unk> for <unk> is the <unk> sign .
why it 's your mindset that 's going on , and it 's getting more and more and more and more .
somebody has a response to this direction , it 's not the dog , it 's your jobs .
and i do n't even want to do with pink break in the pink , there come , and i say , okay , well , you go .
what about my job is beautiful ?
so that 's stupid , even when it 's the pink glasses , it looks like it .
so , something is not beautiful , it does n't work .
the pink rowers is really great to the meeting .
and there 's a wonderful way that they would end up in your eye .
but too , they do n't care .
now , where does that , if we do n't change that ?
in fact , the content , the content , our <unk> ?
within the company outside , as a <unk> .
it might be in a system where we feel like the mouse .
the mouse goes into this cycle , and it comes and it goes , and at some point , it 's going to get the poor mouse and they get out out .
so what does the mouse have ?
you do n't know anything else .
and again , again , and again , the movie several times , again , i think , `` well , you 'll notice you .
this is beautiful <unk> here with hay , so she does n't think there and it 's all over again .
and that , what do we think of as a funny idea , the mouse turn off , right ?
or something needs to do that <unk> <unk> .
and i went over for many years ago , i was home from a seminar .
and then , as the street under me , it felt very black before my eyes and somehow i have to stay .
the next day , i went to doctor , because i thought , what is there ?
he looked at me and said , physically , physically .
but what about the purchasing menu ?
and i looked at my calendar , and i saw this , and i was working three weeks ,
after 20 years ago , the first time period , the first time , in the early days , the first time we can do in the evening at night .
and i thought , well , what else is we actually for jobs ?
and we started <unk> , <unk> , another priorities , to see that i had time with my family , doing something good for me .
<unk> , whether it 's not always the other hand in my job , a new piece of play .
i realized , the talks of a lot of groups that make me joy right .
i just go home counseling and <unk> and other things , but these conversations are going to be able to give these talks to the experiences , experiences that i 'm really happy .
and that was not always that .
and i realize myself that this <unk> also needs to be sick .
and sometimes it takes this shot on the front of the front of it , `` <unk> '' came back to the hospital after he had a heart heart , and he began to play with him .
before i said , you 're going to go with me , it 's always <unk> me , yes , you 're going to walk with your walk and so .
today he goes .
so , with <unk> , beautiful slowly , in the right quadrant , but maybe we 're going to have to go to you .
what happens ?
we 're going to have all the healthier .
the <unk> go down , but a curve , which is the amount of the conditions of mental health .
dow 's four percent in the last last 10 years , six percent less minus 50 percent , which is beautiful , that 's going to be less .
rise of the agricultural diseases plus one percent .
that 's something , where i think is this ?
why is this ?
is that just in austria ?
no , even in germany , it 's so .
<unk> , <unk> , that 's getting all healthier .
that 's so on the left side .
right down the bottom of mental diseases , only plus three percent in the last 10 years , a large german auto stuff .
the number of <unk> <unk> .
plus cost .
and it all sorts of official , what can we do with this topic ?
and all of these things sometimes come out of it , again , <unk> <unk> , like this .
so it 's good .
and somebody said , no alcohol .
but what is the solutions ?
so what is this going to do with , what 's going to be healthy power and exercise and to joy ?
and that triggered me the last year .
i 've been thinking , well there 's something like <unk> , can it be there ?
i 'm a gamer , the job is not what makes us <unk> and happy .
there are many other things that are important , family , health , faith and so on .
but the fact is that we spend the biggest part of our <unk> in work .
and when we do that , why do n't we do so that it 's us going to be joy and also another .
i mean , i 'm going to do it as a last piece of time to <unk> and <unk> .
and these little <unk> that you 're going to get to notice .
<unk> stands for talent , freedom and environment .
that means , how do i get my talents ?
in terms of the environment , i do this , too ?
what freedom have i want to do what i want to do ?
because the degrees of the <unk> that we have .
the more of it , the more stress .
and what do i do ?
that 's the common-sense possible .
and this is where those four parts are .
and it can be a problem for yourself .
i had to take that for me , and i had to do that again , and i 'm going to go back and over again .
can i use my talents ?
in the environment ?
and that means sometimes sometimes i go into a cafe with my laptop , to make the seminar or a <unk> .
the freedom .
and what freedom i can take to do is to do that , what matters .
and do i do it ?
that 's the common-sense possible .
the last mile .
and then there 's always people who tell me why this is not .
and why that 's a lot of difficulty for you .
and i 'd like to make a response to this place .
you want to find ways .
i do n't , who did n't .
and by the point , you can choose yourself , do i get ways , `` i am i doing why ?
and they 're right in both .
so what do we do with our dopamine ?
each of you have the great <unk> .
it 's too much too small .
this is filled with <unk> , with gold , with everything possible with your skills .
what are we doing ?
and by the end , we 're asking this .
or if we lie in the hospital or the end of a life .
what did i do with my collaborator ?
by the way , who 's looking at <unk> <unk> , like , i like to think about it still .
so , what do we do with our talent , is my first question , too , to me , and it 's every day .
do i have good enough ?
and resources .
there was one with a story .
i wanted to talk about <unk> .
and that 's what i 'm going to do .
the fortress was saving for the <unk> than a dime ago , was the enemy .
and the enemies realized that this disconnect was so good that you could n't take them .
seven walls of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the agricultural , the thick north of the <unk> , thick doors , <unk> .
it was <unk> then .
so here 's what happens , okay , if we do n't get inside , then we form a <unk> .
we do n't make it out more and it 's in .
let 's take a look at how long did this .
and the <unk> ceremony took out of a long to the day , where there were almost illegal .
they had an issue of a <unk> who was already on the way to the bishop , send me this <unk> and give me three days .
you have , come on , you 've got you ; i <unk> you , come , get the <unk> and your family .
<unk> goes to the <unk> .
and at once , you see , the enemy that the wall of the ceo of the ceo of the ceo of the ceo of the ceo of the ceo of the ceo of the ceo of the ceo of the ceo of the ceo of the ceo of the ceo of the ceo of the ceo of the fortress , again , over the left to the right , and it 's
well , think of it , a <unk> , what is that .
it 's gone .
again , a <unk> <unk> , the <unk> on the wall of the fortress .
please think , oh , well , who has two <unk> , it can take one thing .
at the evening the same scenario , this time , this is what he knows is that it knows there , which is on and off .
at the end of the second day , after the six different <unk> , they turned into a <unk> .
because they thought that takes us for a long time , that we do n't think anymore .
and then they went down to the <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
one thing that they had and they had .
that 's what the <unk> <unk> came from .
i like this idea that everything we need , and we have everything .
sometimes it 's common resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's little .
but also we can do something .
we have no idea of power that we have started to invent the world a day .
and if you think it might be a good end of what they 're right .
in the spring , the spring .
it 's coming .
and we 're going to know where the snow is going to get it down to the plants from branches brown to the green <unk> .
and there are some other things coming out of these blooms of these blooms .
and there 's a great thing that we harvest and eat .
there 's grain of that grain , we can <unk> and bread .
there are any animals that eat it .
there 's the people who are eating the products out of that .
and it 's automatically coming .
but if you think about it , that may not automatically do it , it 's going to be a fear and <unk> .
and of course , this threat may just be very , very abstract and also very , but at least in the realm of the game , the connection of the <unk> , is a very , very big role .
there are research that show that to exist percent of our food , in particular , there would be no bees .
and that sounds like that , because it 's so much for us , and we do n't even perceive that .
there 's been a very interesting film , <unk> , to the subject .
and i assure you , look at it .
now , let 's look at the great <unk> of the world 's now working with bees who 's in my school , in <unk> , the importance of bees do this .
this is what he 's doing here at a school school , and he 'll tell us a lot about his work .
please , mr. <unk> .
yes , good evening .
it 's just a big thank you , mr. <unk> , and the whole thing .
so i 'm here with my project , <unk> , i 'm going to talk about the life of bees .
and that 's even more under one wing , and it 's a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit of <unk> , which is fun .
now , i 'll think that the potential of you may be <unk> , it would be a <unk> company now for me to learn to the basics of women 's tales .
i do n't do that , no .
but maybe it is , you know , you 're going to get these <unk> to love or to develop some empathy , and you 're going to be able to get them for this <unk> , <unk> glass .
my name is thomas <unk> , i 'm <unk> years old with a wonderful woman , dad from five kids at <unk> and <unk> and adults .
i 'm a member of a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the lab .
and now work now in the <unk> world , in the <unk> , <unk> with our <unk> students .
we 're working there in the garden , in agriculture and in our mind .
but it 's actually a play of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
our flying classroom is more a <unk> , a <unk> , a quiet thing .
and she 's also going to quiet .
it 's almost a <unk> .
and not for free have the ancient greeks have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> .
and in a wonderful verse of homer , he 's like the <unk> <unk> , he describes his <unk> to the <unk> poets to inspire him that he can blow .
but you 're not going to send the blue connection , but they send their blue and <unk> at the top of the skin and in the corner , with him later the words of honey .
it 's a beautiful image .
hopefully i 'll get this tonight today .
yes .
the flying classroom .
i come to the project .
one of these examples , this <unk> drone has now taken my students with me up , for 30 to <unk> days .
in <unk> schools of us in <unk> schools , or in the <unk> of <unk> , or in the <unk> .
a <unk> <unk> , or in <unk> of us in <unk> .
the teacher who walks this project with me in the class , and we 're looking for a <unk> space for this .
usually , the children 's children can see something during this month .
and all of the things that the bees that then there are in there through the tube , and again .
it 's being created at the window .
here .
and then the whole thing begins with me on the turntable .
so i 'm going to take a <unk> , and you can now pull out of a existing sample of <unk> two <unk> , and you can see here in these balloons .
so this is what we want to do is this <unk> are <unk> bees .
so , as important , we have <unk> <unk> , and here 's going to be fresh <unk> , fresh eggs .
and then a <unk> , here 's the top .
there 's the honey inside .
they need , if you 're bad weather , and you ca n't fly .
here .
that 's what it looks like .
and then the <unk> <unk> over here again , and immediately the way down to the <unk> places , or in the schools in school .
and now , something wonderful starts .
ladies and gentlemen , the bees in the class , in the course , there 's a crisis in the classroom .
your people are not getting more .
they 're lonely .
you do n't think your queen .
and that 's the most important problem , if it makes these <unk> design that he 's on the queen in the older people .
so that 's not based on these two <unk> .
and they 're sad , these bees .
they 're starting to <unk> .
yes , the <unk> says , she <unk> .
you hear that .
they 're almost attracted to a <unk> higher than if they normally usually the queen of the queen .
and now , a <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , in a night , you now have the need to get a new choice , and all of this is what happens to the needs , <unk> , without having a conversation , without opinions and positions .
so here 's the people you want to agree with , and then you put a <unk> in the first night .
because , without the queen , this people would n't exist after six weeks .
for only six weeks .
here .
and in the first night , she would come out of one of this dung square into a square machine , and you put this in these booths .
and then you can <unk> the queen .
anybody who had <unk> in high school , says how to this ?
yeah , genetically <unk> , is all genetically <unk> .
that 's true .
and now , something wonderful starts .
and so this is an idea here in the '50s department of a <unk> <unk> .
the egg has the first three days of the same genetic code as the <unk> .
and then , it becomes used by a <unk> <unk> .
you know that term .
and immediately , it 's changing on this membrane to <unk> the genetic code .
they 're going to change the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> .
we have heard that what we eat , that determines what we will .
and the queen is really wonderful to experience .
three days , egg , five days <unk> .
and you can do it all the students .
this is what you see in education .
and then this cell will sound <unk> with a <unk> claw , and it does n't happen , because the people are now democratic and <unk> , or because of a <unk> , that 's like it or you have a name of a group curve , you 're doing this .
no , that 's what happens .
ladies and gentlemen , this is a <unk> or a <unk> .
and then the students are going to wait eight days every student , three five five five , eight , eight , eight five eight days ago .
and on the day , if you 're supposed to happen , the teacher has the arm in the front of the students in the students in the students in the students in the students in the students in the students in the students in the students in the students in the students in the students .
and then the mom says , `` well , what about you ?
yes , i got to school .
yes , why is that ?
yes , the queen <unk> .
yes ?
and then the back in the morning in school .
and then you hit their <unk> on this <unk> , because they want to <unk> like this queen now .
and if you really want to do that , you know something .
this is a queen .
here .
one more higher .
and then you get the <unk> , and they cut the queen .
the first thing that the queen is doing , they changed their wings , and then you have your smell , your smell , your smell , her <unk> .
the people have a identity .
now , three to five days five days .
you see your <unk> <unk> .
the earth comes out of the people , from the <unk> .
and after five days , these queen came out of the <unk> .
some think now , yes , i 've seen this , you know , this is a <unk> <unk> .
stop , get .
and different .
that 's what we let .
these queen , they 're paying alone on no <unk> , without foresight , from this <unk> out to two miles .
you may have seen in your closet .
in the '50s condition , there 's <unk> , from seven to 12 drones , the male bees .
so the queen , like in islam where the man 's going to have to have the queen , the seven to 12 men .
and this is happening in a wonderful way .
the drone comes from the back of the queen , and the queen , and this queen now in this stunning world , which they need three years eggs .
for the drone , it 's also an amazing experience .
if they finished , you die and fall dead from the sky .
and then the queen comes back and starts to put eggs .
there 's always one two student in the class that you see .
and you 'll notice the queen immediately .
yes .
and then slowly the project back to school , and now the queen and the <unk> are now getting close .
and then i would come up with one night , and then i 'd like to do this <unk> .
<unk> <unk> from the outside of the outside , and the next morning <unk> i have these <unk> with the queen and these bees .
and here you see the queen .
yes .
new <unk> instructor .
and we have 10 to 12 or 12 .
and then this yes , these two data will come here in a <unk> .
in a full cane , in a position , and now this person can be large and powerful .
why bees in school ?
ladies and gentlemen the children who have experienced , never forget that .
yes .
so yes , yes , it 's not just that in this class then the students all of the students are in the bees , but the whole school comes into this class in this classroom .
and the teacher , when he can do something , when he can be something , when he can get a little prepared , it can be a <unk> in the other .
so , take a look , bees and you have a look at the same time in front of the world 's shoes , where people have all the honey .
a few months ago , you have <unk> years old <unk> years ago where people have thought back the bees .
every human culture , with honeybees ,
or the other time , the bees were in every culture .
in china , in peru , in egypt , in egypt , in greece .
and they were in that .
the human cultures ladies and gentlemen .
it can be a <unk> , a <unk> , and he can plug you up .
ladies and gentlemen , what are flowers or the trees who need them ?
that 's what you find out of there now , now in the summer in the summer .
that 's out there , this is the green desert for our bees .
yes ?
he can go to the students in the <unk> and there 's flowers of people who are looking for the <unk> , and look , how long need now to do now to my flowers ?
how long are you on the individuals ?
and as long as you need them to come back again .
it can be <unk> .
how do i <unk> a hexagon ?
yes .
you know , if that 's the peak up to the top , or is a flat side of your corner ?
take a look .
and he can do a math -- and it can plug in the math .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he ca n't find the <unk> <unk> on this earth .
and then he comes to the question , how could karl <unk> of fresh <unk> the nobel prize ?
because he managed to see the bees that indicate the bees .
but my ladies and gentlemen , in a notice it 's <unk> .
there 's a bee bee .
and just the professor <unk> , who spent a lot of years in <unk> university , which has been in <unk> , that the bees can create a <unk> effect on the <unk> .
like a <unk> web out of the wax web to make a <unk> net , and now you can <unk> some of some footage there , and the bees , the <unk> , the record with your legs , with their <unk> .
you see what these bees are doing in school ?
it 's <unk> <unk> , and the kids are lost their fear .
and developing a awareness of the bees .
they learn , <unk> , is what the bees do .
and they get an expedition in terms of this , which is basically just humans .
the bees ca n't do huge amounts of a kilo of the people in the year .
<unk> years ago , the only way the only way to make candles .
they accumulate the <unk> out on the trees .
this is a <unk> , where they look at their people .
and now , think about this , in summer , these are <unk> -- and <unk> bees in such a narrow space in <unk> degrees .
hey , there 's over there .
no , in the bees .
because they have antibiotics in this conceptual natural natural .
you 're collecting the pollen , and it 's making it <unk> , it becomes a <unk> ,
someone who 's on the stage is , ok , <unk> , <unk> of africa today can go to a <unk> , and to let a <unk> band by incorporating the <unk> from the people .
well , of course , there 's an grid in front of it and with a <unk> and so on , there 's nothing .
yes , and then my ladies and gentlemen , the <unk> , the bees , and we would have less apples if the bees would n't fly , or we 'd have to do the chinese just in the <unk> and they 're going to be entrepreneurial .
there 's many more insights .
look at the <unk> area , because there are the main increase on the cancer , it 's where the cows are sucked up .
and then the bee is looking down to your nectar , and you 've got some kind of <unk> .
and now the cow is the cow , and it 's the <unk> , and only , because they 're <unk> <unk> , can digest them .
yes ?
and then you put that again and see , ah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , ah , i can <unk> it again .
and then there 's milk .
that 's what the bee bee is .
yes ?
and in the end of the bee , the bee is telling us what it exists on nature .
the honey .
i want to come to the point , <unk> .
my students look at every year , every year , every year , every year they go to the schools .
now , this is not what i 'm doing now , but i did n't have a student , and i said , in the middle of the school in <unk> , and i said , `` you know , '' you 'd put yourself yourself yourself .
and then he says , yes , i <unk> hot .
i 'll come from <unk> with <unk> , and i 'm 20 years .
and i 've been in <unk> for five years , and since two years ago .
and i 'm glad to talk to me that i do n't have to learn to learn about studying learning , but with your hands .
<unk> , yes , with your head .
and a <unk> went through the <unk> , <unk> college .
and more than half , yeah , that 's what we want to do .
my students experience a tremendous appreciation and the ones between , in quotes , regular and the <unk> people will give people through the bees .
you can go up and you get self-esteem , my students and a certain .
so , how come to bee ?
the question is wrong .
you have to say , how do you have to say , how do you get to the <unk> ?
and i think , well , there 's the human man who <unk> the other people , and it 's a new tool .
and he says , you start to start .
at the end , a little piece of <unk> <unk> .
you know , who like the bee would be the sun through the sun , and never the direction of the fields of the fields of the fields in <unk> psychiatry , as quickly he was rarely cry .
thank you very much .
hi , love friends in the world .
welcome to talk to me .
that 's the project my person and my wife .
it 's the struggle to a end of female genital genital genital mutilation .
in my view , the largest crime of humanity , because it has been used for a hundred years .
society versus women are still <unk> and <unk> victims .
first of the first , i 'm going to imagine .
my name is <unk> , i 'm coming from hamburg .
that 's where i was <unk> years old .
you can think that the job is not <unk> .
i did n't feel like it .
and that was what i was happy to do was that i could <unk> good <unk> and <unk> .
for instance , this .
with a massive primer over the atlantic of africa to brazil .
on the demo , a crocodile in the <unk> brazil of brazil in brazil , the <unk> indians , to prevent the <unk> .
this was a drive where i was more more than <unk> , more subversive than <unk> .
and yet , this is what i could think about is to find the interest of the media , and even a smaller human , and i could make his cause around the world .
<unk> , i took with a few of the <unk> in ethiopia 's ethiopia .
at the time , there was a war between the 19th and ethiopia , and we were <unk> of this decline .
and despite all the cruelty that we 've experienced , we were on the other side , the infinite hospitality of the <unk> that was <unk> us ,
and what happened then we were abandoned , and our two instincts that you see here with their bodies and the <unk> they said , that 's my <unk> .
if you want to kill your teachers , they have to shoot .
i did something like that in any other culture .
and then at least , in the age of young , in young years , learned where you do n't rely on terrorism , in terrorism .
and christians do n't want to respond to their terrorism .
for example , the <unk> .
the <unk> , the <unk> .
but rather than the real values like this , social responsibility .
these are the values to fight it .
after many years , i 've been back in the hospital , together with my wife <unk> .
and then we heard about this <unk> female circumcision .
when i heard about that <unk> percent of the everyday victims , the rest are christians and <unk> , i think , `` how do i think of islam as much clean , could n't let anything <unk> in the shoes ?
and the idea was born with the highest leaders of islam to explain the practice .
we were looking for the ministry of soy organizations that we did n't .
we would have had to hear that we would be totally <unk> , because islam was not <unk> .
i would give me the <unk> .
on <unk> international times , we 've created our own organization .
and it was <unk> and <unk> .
and to do this struggle , we need pictures .
because of a absence .
and so <unk> <unk> , and i returned to those desert with just these pictures .
the bad <unk> pictures , i 'm not going to show you , but i want to be the crime .
girl in the age of four weeks to the wedding , i would get to the wedding , and then you put them on the limbs , and they put them with the <unk> and the praise of <unk> <unk> with a <unk> instruments without a conflict and the <unk> .
what you 've left is a staircase from the size of a <unk> .
now , let 's play a population .
if you 're going to get your rule , they 're two weeks .
it destroyed the body and soul , the way it was .
that was the start called <unk> <unk> .
it 's going on .
the man has to open it up .
he still saw a <unk> woman .
the uncle told him , oh , well , is n't a problem .
you put your penis , and then you get very hard .
and if you do n't , it 's not bad .
and then you take the knife and you look at it .
this is <unk> <unk> .
there 's a third of the girls .
that was three months ago .
shock before that girl lost his language .
these are the <unk> , even some in asia .
most of them are fiction .
and whenever we were muslims , why did you do that ?
it was the <unk> answer , which we have to do , this is the koran .
nothing is in the koran in the koran .
and every single thing , <unk> times hundreds of times every day in prayer , like <unk> <unk> , the creator , is perfect , <unk> .
but they do n't seem to think what you pray .
and she 's <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> of the women , and why you can now as a <unk> human beings .
but now we had the pictures of the first few favelas .
he <unk> us , his whole <unk> <unk> .
there was a hard conversation , two days .
but we had the minister on our page , the highest <unk> on our site .
and then the great decision , the need against all human rights , versus religion , we have to ban him .
as a matter , this new <unk> signed signed .
and when you know africa and the <unk> , you know , only that 's familiar for these people .
and it 's been celebrated , and we had the successes in other countries .
so quick example , <unk> , <unk> , the highest drama of the country , the <unk> of the country 's worth its message , that it 's an crime to write , to write a <unk> , and you 're going to carry in the <unk> .
in the days , we were on the road , with your moons of war .
we have a hundred of <unk> .
and where we came from , we just have open facial ears , open arms and a historic , ancient arts .
and when we wanted to leave the country , the great <unk> and <unk> <unk> , do you want to look at all the rotten countries ?
there 's a lot of life that will not give you more .
he 's right .
i 'm a gamer , and you have to come slowly .
and so , he had an idea .
he said , if it was to take 10 <unk> blind to a table to sin , it 's a sin .
<unk> and i went to a <unk> and -- <unk> <unk> with the vatican of the <unk> .
and the <unk> for <unk> right , the <unk> <unk> , his <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> .
he listened to the idea of it , but it was , in fact , when we were discovering it , that we would finance .
and that 's what we 're doing is to think about things that support us .
and then he said , i 'm going to not just <unk> the conference , so as we had asked him , but i 'm going to take the <unk> .
and he did .
and over over a while there 's been our transparent out over time .
international <unk> in the <unk> of female bodies of female bodies .
under the '50s , <unk> doctor ,
and everybody has gone .
a hundred <unk> , but the top of the world .
in the middle of the <unk> , the guy has <unk> in his 40s , and in the rest of europe , he 's the source of <unk> for cartoons .
so men can tell the lives and death .
but it 's also the other .
the force on the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , my <unk> .
the highest highest .
i think about what i 'm going to do is i 'm just a couple of a vacuum and <unk> .
and then i 've all sort of beat them .
it started the conference .
and under our frill , under the <unk> of the left , the <unk> of egypt , and egypt .
the <unk> <unk> of <unk> egypt , <unk> egypt , <unk> by the wife and <unk> <unk> , germany .
so much of islam is not <unk> .
we also had the same time , and the nurses also had the same time in its own ways , what 's a terrible thing to do with the <unk> .
and then you could show up a film , <unk> .
reality .
men have <unk> eyes .
she moved back to the <unk> doors , after only two hours , he was expected and a <unk> , a <unk> .
the <unk> goes front of the cameras , announced what you have .
and the most important sentence , that was this .
female injuries is a <unk> of crime against the highest values of islam .
he <unk> the audio .
we did , the job is done , but it did n't have done the calculation .
because the shame to talk about the woman of the woman is more likely to talk to everybody .
that 's why we have <unk> .
we have this conference documented in this so-called golden book .
a <unk> tool for the world 's population of the world .
and because ali <unk> , the <unk> , it was so good , the book he did it with a practice .
it will lay us out of hands .
we were in many countries in many countries , then we had to have the last highest <unk> .
and they were uploading this with interest some , they have the book .
however , most of the time , most of the courage , most of the time , it 's too short .
you do n't want to talk about the <unk> of the mosque .
just a few people have it .
they 're at the universities in the universities .
and sometimes we 've found some <unk> <unk> that actually have the <unk> in the 1980 , like this .
and then it goes out of speakers in the <unk> .
and these are the things they are .
they 're going to spread it .
but i 'm on time .
it 's all sides of hot stones , and that 's why i 'm working on many different strategies , this topic .
the practice .
but my favorite version is that it was that .
i want to announce the great message of the highest <unk> of islam in the world of islam , which is in the kaaba .
not <unk> <unk> , but in the <unk> .
when there are four million people come together , men and women have islamic <unk> .
and then you know , in all of these , and the owner of king my fortune up there between the '60s .
like i 've done this , i 've got to do that .
unfortunately , the last ted , which is the `` king . ''
but i 'm sure if he 's going to talk about it , he 'll turn up .
for one thing to help these gals .
now , to show the world , which is the real values of islam , instead , instead of slipping .
forty than <unk> .
if i do n't like that , i think that what has happened in hamburg .
at least a lot of <unk> in the mosques all over the world .
and we could make that transparent .
and maybe i do n't think that little girl needs to have a daughters .
and then my life has so wrong .
and i want to talk about everybody who 's now here or to stop .
there 's not one more <unk> .
we have to step out the practice that 's happening , right ?
and now i 'm going to show you to the kind of the design of my <unk> .
that 's my favorite , my <unk> .
and this is in all its top up there in the name of arabic , and you do n't know that .
down there , we have in german .
female bell is with the koran and the ethics of islam .
it 's <unk> and a discrimination of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so i start looking for it .
and this is what the prairies looked like you got as a <unk> in germany .
on the <unk> , my mother , my brother , and i used to the first time .
it <unk> authorship .
my mom was totally disturbed , because they did n't understand why they 've given care conferencing .
the third day , we 've finally been interested .
we stood on the service and then again , and then a <unk> woman and <unk> that was just against <unk> .
she tried to explain us to what you can eat .
that 's not uncommon .
and that tastes very good .
it 's cheese .
my mom took his eyebrows up , and we were laughing .
cheese .
in my own country , we have practiced , but it 's not such <unk> .
i 'm <unk> <unk> and <unk> years old .
i 'm with my mom and my mom and my brother from china to germany .
now , from this escape i tell you today .
but , mostly , it 's about the people who have allowed these services and have made a success story .
but first , let me tell you where i 'm really excited .
i 'm <unk> .
<unk> are a little <unk> that live in the northwest of china .
and this region is called autonomous area called the autonomous area .
it 's about <unk> miles away from germany .
in china , tens of millions of interest in china is the largest temperate community outside of china .
and that 's life here because we have to have a lot of interests in china .
hundreds of thousands of chinese have been upgraded to <unk> adolescents that we have become in our own home .
our own native language , <unk> was <unk> from education system .
in schools and in universities , is going to be <unk> .
and furthermore , we ca n't act free .
so they are losing their culture and identity .
and if you 're bold , and for the right , the <unk> of the ministry of <unk> , or even death or death .
that was also the reason my parents decided to flee with us .
that was <unk> , and i was back to 11 years old .
the picture is just a short thing ago .
we had n't had enough money , so my dad had to leave it out .
and i <unk> for many people who helped us in the run .
i <unk> , many images .
i <unk> <unk> , but first of all , let 's have our <unk> technician .
i just <unk> him when i 'm my eyes .
he was big had <unk> , and we met him with his little <unk> on a parking lot .
the first of the street was relocated .
i know many of a <unk> image of <unk> have <unk> that the only business do n't have any business , and you do n't care at the fates .
but i 'd like to say , `` oh , '' i said , `` oh , '' not as a <unk> .
because they had signed .
he stood up at the airport of the airport , <unk> on a <unk> , and he summarized on the last end of the <unk> , whether we were also safe by the <unk> .
airport in <unk> we came up with this , and i know how my mother somehow said to me go out of the airport .
you do n't care .
we 're out there .
because i had a look at my hand in my hand , and there was also my photo in my hand , <unk> , <unk> .
i had to use as a <unk> tool .
and i 'm happy <unk> at me , he <unk> my seat .
silence .
<unk> .
a long .
we were finally <unk> .
in munich , in munich , i have a lot of the workers who kind of supporting us .
i <unk> ' <unk> woman who used to be used with us in the <unk> .
in a <unk> with four <unk> per family per families .
at least , at least .
a <unk> and a kitchen .
there was foreign faces .
and lots of different languages .
and we had no privacy .
my mom , my brother and i had to share a <unk> .
there were eaten , ready and homework .
and my friends do n't come to visit , because i <unk> where we used .
just my favorite <unk> in the <unk> knew .
and she had seen my story and i made it very , and she took care to me .
so for example , she took me to me with me what i do n't do anymore .
but it helped me somehow know german <unk> .
i spent my way in the <unk> .
that was not for my mom .
just with us without your husband , and you 're in uncertainty because we had only one <unk> and could even get a lot more .
and i <unk> for me that i was very , very violent .
it 's also a little bit more embarrassing , but now i have to stand to my story .
i was very aggressive , and i could really focus in high school .
they brought us to <unk> where we came to the first time with normal kids .
with normal my time , i had to go to a decent center .
and i <unk> , i am also interested in the <unk> of my brother and my brother .
just with that .
and i <unk> <unk> , and i did n't have done with the number of women who did homework , because our parents do n't have a german .
or they 're just solid .
we always have very happy .
i still know how we 've always been looking at the fence and wait until these people came , because somehow , strangers , foreign people for us , and that was what it was .
after two years , finally , my father came to germany .
but the problem was that he had no longer in munich , in munich , there was no room for him .
and i <unk> <unk> from the very , very few songs that did it , my father , after china , he managed to help us in munich in munich .
and i <unk> <unk> at this time where i really get it very , very happy , because after six years , we finally had a normal school trip .
we got a fulbright for three years , and we finally got one time with a few years , and we finally had a own trip with one another and a half .
and i even had one room .
it was very small , and i did n't have a desk inside , but it was good , i was able to do my door .
and i do n't know what i 've left for the time , and i had to take a good place , but i had to leave the <unk> .
i really did n't look for me .
and there was a <unk> that i can always give me up in the <unk> , and it 's still going to push on the idea that i can <unk> my <unk> <unk> .
first of the first , <unk> <unk> .
and i thank you very much the teacher that really believed in me , and i was really not just that time , i would even get it to the mid-west .
and i came up with the <unk> .
and before i first came to the ward , i was walking on my best friend <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is an organization or a project , <unk> <unk> .
but i did n't have a good job that i had to do , because we had a place where we could just go .
we had a valve that we could <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
and the head of <unk> technology that we had to tell our problems , and he 's given us , and we could kind of <unk> us all the questions .
and then i came up to the <unk> , <unk> .
and this is a project where young people do n't get an opportunity to get the possibility to cope with .
i really did this really well , and i realized art is something that i 'm also doing .
through <unk> and <unk> , a filmmaker we came up with a filmmaker .
he made the film <unk> over my friends and me .
and the film won many dollars .
we realized that people were interested in our history .
he was a very literal sense of because we had never seen people listening .
and that was the moment i thought , okay .
i do n't want anymore anymore .
i want to make something out of my life .
a collaborator of <unk> , a <unk> for refugees came up with me to a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
but there 's what i had in the back building all of my time , i happen to meet a <unk> for a play and the title is one to four .
so i was really right .
i played with .
and the amazing thing is that after a performance of two editors <unk> to me .
and i 'd have asked me if i was interested in taking care of their own .
i thought , well , <unk> .
i mean , i 'm doing .
and i was <unk> for the ministry of <unk> , and i poured into the <unk> , and one of my parts of a piece of <unk> , where i was also paid to the european <unk> .
and i won him .
now i study the grad school for the ministry of justice , and i 'm <unk> in the third year .
and that would n't be possible for me to do n't have any or organizations like <unk> or projects like <unk> good for me .
they 'd have believed me in the spaces of my spaces , they have shown me ways i can make my place in society .
and i come to you now .
each one of them has the ability to help people like me , and their lives or their place in society .
because the people , they come from a hundred refugees from a hundred refugees and each one of them have a big potential .
they 've made it with big determination to make lots of terrifying each other .
and with that mandate , they could really be able to be a profit for germany and for every given of us .
and i could have a thousand things to what you can do , but because i did n't have time enough time , one minute , i brought you a <unk> cop .
now , let you get your mobile phone out of your cellphone , you can not tell you that they ca n't .
let 's scan the code , and then you come to the side of <unk> with a lot of detail that they can do .
and that would help us feel good .
i 'm now ashamed of remorse , and we 're going to see ourselves outside .
and scan it the code .
i do it .
you do n't have a lot of the mobile phone .
do you have that same thing , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
<unk> yeah .
it 's like a <unk> cop .
i 'm very pleased to make ourselves .
my name is <unk> .
my <unk> is <unk> as it talks .
i 'll get one of austria , which is in vienna .
i 'm very excited to myself today is really beautiful .
i 'm very comfortable here every time .
and this is not rocket science , it 's a feeling .
yes , yes , unlike the other , i 'm not here today to talk about anything .
i did n't know what .
but it 's so much that i 'm writing writing in my leisure , and then it 's a bit of talk , usually at <unk> or <unk> or <unk> like this .
yes , and i asked to think of a couple of texts here , to put the whole program a little bit .
and that 's exactly what i 'm doing now .
yes .
let me begin with a joke .
hit two chickens .
so , you know , you 're two english chicken , so you 're not <unk> and <unk> , but <unk> times very funny i 'm wearing and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
it 's the other scary thing .
so , let me tell you a little bit about <unk> .
so here we have the problem .
the first text is a little <unk> that i wrote .
i have a person to tell me what it means .
it 's called the title .
and yeah , she did n't really understand it .
when your head in my ceiling was the rest of my ceiling .
my leg was also under my ceiling on the ceiling .
my leg was through the ceiling .
it 's about your head on my lap , the rest of her , the rest of her , my leg outside of the ceiling .
this has <unk> , when my leg was extremely challenging .
it was very romantic .
the next one , i was also a person who was going to be a little bit .
and my grandpa .
we have no longer contact .
my <unk> grandfather was a bust .
already , he has <unk> off a lot .
it 's like me .
yes , it 's still <unk> text .
you wo n't .
jesus is the only mistake that 's on the glass of the bus .
now , where was some of it who did n't have to save me that way ?
now , is there , yes ?
did i have a <unk> course ?
text text .
the next text is a little bit more .
he 's actually a second .
so to writing .
it 's faster .
it 's the beginning of a novel that i 'm on the <unk> .
ah , it 's about cartography guys , so the adventure from a guy who always follow the hair and a little bit of <unk> .
and i 'm always going to kick myself back to this point i distance .
because i would never shut the hair off .
chapter one .
if i 'm going to get my head painted .
so , like the page that he tried to fill .
yes , i did n't come .
very hard one .
the next text is also a little four-bar currency .
most people do n't understand .
i 'm going to make myself feel hard .
and that 's what i like to play with my vocabulary and with my language .
i always love with me .
and yes , they come out of things like this .
it 's called the title .
it 's a little bit very strange .
is n't the most vulnerable thing i ever wrote .
<unk> <unk> .
yes , we need .
we can all of them .
we <unk> .
i did n't know .
but i can .
i can do .
i do n't .
yes , i did n't understand it .
no idea .
yes , <unk> from me .
i always tell you , either or no .
the next piece of paper has to do with text .
somehow , it 's kind of a little <unk> .
i wrote back to insects .
thank you .
yes , it 's still <unk> text .
it 's a little <unk> .
and it 's really cool if i 'm going to make your three thoughts .
my text carries the title , all good things are cool .
so now , <unk> ontogeny is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so we have to go , <unk> , <unk> , and you 're getting away , and yes , that 's it .
wonderful moment .
yes , even <unk> , which is this time another .
and it 's really cool if i 'm going to do that , so we 're all going to try to do that , so we try all the time .
that 's exactly what the wind is doing .
the lyrics is called the title and the way this is what it goes .
yes .
it 's fun to you .
the <unk> text is just a sentence .
i write `` write '' as little nets . ''
this is an <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is with <unk> .
<unk> s ?
yes , yeah .
it 's fun to you .
yes , there 's a <unk> sentence .
this is in <unk> .
it 's a very long sentence .
i think it almost impossible to explain to explain , that 's the point .
here , another text .
this day is a <unk> .
it 's the title of the text .
this day is a <unk> , and he knows .
and he knows it before , before i have him as these <unk> .
he took me a little bit of me , then he would let me <unk> me .
i could later <unk> it later .
i made him the joy .
it was a <unk> before every other days ago .
with a <unk> , <unk> in where else ?
and intention , it does n't want to give it more to credit by me .
and i would n't wake up afterward , and i 'm looking at it in a bad day .
you have hope , right ?
now it 's time for a little joke .
what was the more einstein telling him when he was his steak ?
i plan .
here .
so i think that 's what i want to do is a little bit like the cow .
that 's funny .
yes , the next text has learned the paper .
it 's more interesting .
so , i 'm not just funny things .
i mean , it 's really a lot of political things .
and i often ask you where i 'm doing <unk> .
and , yeah , i wrote this text here .
he 's wearing the title `` <unk> . ''
my father came from vienna , and then in my mother and i made it .
yes .
we would have the same thing .
thank you very much for the sound .
yes , in this case , i like to make a little advertising .
i ca n't have a business or anything like that , so i have to keep doing this .
and i 'm also going to pull myself in vienna , and i 'm also going to make a <unk> in vienna .
so , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , would like to show up .
and yeah , i <unk> , i really <unk> 'em .
and , yeah .
i just said .
it 's on the program .
more advertising .
this is a little advertisement i wrote .
feet .
rich of vitamin c .
so the <unk> .
half of them .
it 's very funny .
i want to write a joke about your friend 's 13-year-old friend , but the punch was just flat .
yes , it 's not exactly my <unk> .
you know , <unk> you , to stop the <unk> <unk> , you get into the <unk> edges of it .
yes .
thank you very much .
she was great .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
let me begin with a <unk> question .
so why do you ever run your policy at all ?
i mean , every one , the easiest way that you should use , is what he can give up to the other part of the society .
the answer is clear .
we now know that life expectancy is at the birth of birth , is just about <unk> percent genetically engineered .
that 's what you have to do have to do any of the world , <unk> have the influence of the influence .
why do n't we know that much more ?
why are we taking out of god 's news from the <unk> news , which will contradict each other each other ?
you might have learned two years ago .
it was fat .
and you thought , when you get fat from the food , we 're all going to watch and become healthy age .
what 's happening in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of a different <unk> in american languages , and what has nothing changed from the americans .
then you have said , well , no .
but not the fat .
they 're the carbs .
and then what 's happening is the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> and so forth .
so it 's going to go back into the new york and again , it 's going to be <unk> in the village .
where all the <unk> ?
well , the reason to my favorite part is to come to my fancy , at least , is that we 're <unk> <unk> practice <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
it 's an example of a <unk> cloud .
you all know the <unk> you all know .
<unk> published a lot of computational magazine .
the top <unk> of the <unk> <unk> for this year .
and keith forward was seven years long .
then the newspaper died .
or this lady here .
<unk> <unk> .
the oldest man had ever lived on the earth .
<unk> years old .
i know there are other people who say , they 're nuts , but you ca n't find your <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is actually <unk> .
and she listened to smoke , but she began to follow the path of virtue and to smoke .
with zero-sum people , they have died .
what does that tell us ?
i do n't think violent healthy .
but it tells us that perhaps is very complicated and that we need clean statistics , we need to have a simple thing , and we have to ask simple questions .
so it 's very simple question , and a very simple thing that is in different countries , women 's women will become older than men .
what is this ?
we know it now .
so that 's what the testosterone is being produced in the male <unk> .
and there 's some simple proof of things as the women are being as old as women .
now , everyone for yourself to think about whether it 's an <unk> device .
austria is a hot country .
but it 's getting better , not fear .
in general , we 're going to be able to do gears with <unk> .
sounds complicated , but it 's just to illustrate the perfect <unk> .
so , here 's a lot of a day of somebody who 's serving my grandma and ask , what did you do so different , or otherwise they 're so old ?
ah .
they sent every day 10 to <unk> .
this is probably the secret of your age , right ?
in fact , the 10 degrees maybe just do n't exist .
or , you know , they would have <unk> and the grandma would like to be older .
even the hard statistics are not always <unk> .
so , for example , there 's very hard to see that people , the <unk> in the <unk> are older than people who do n't .
165 .
it 's wavy .
is this <unk> <unk> ?
no .
it 's because people just have enough money in the pocket to care about your age and the <unk> .
but if i 'm a group of <unk> buildings for food , and this group has n't received the <unk> of the <unk> , but otherwise , i think , i think , i think , i think , actually , i think , i think , actually , i think , i think , actually , i think , actually , i think , i think , i think , actually , i think , i think , actually , in fact , have a backup factor in diet .
and indeed , that 's what they have been made .
so you have to tell you , well , you know , the <unk> is really practical , but even i 'm suggesting with my enemies , is that fierce <unk> are gaining life .
and that works for all of these things .
for example , bacteria .
and you see here , there are many bacteria here .
when we get the fast forward , in the pre-industrial line , that 's going to be a very much longer .
the same thing is true for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> mice , and recently , about two years ago in the united states , that it 's even for monkeys .
it 's not about being thin .
it also works with the <unk> <unk> .
and this is another experiment experiment in the united states .
what did you do here ?
you 've taken over <unk> , and it 's a so-called diet , a <unk> diet where they have so many of you get there day and night .
and who 's believed that the mice are turned thick , sick , sick , and have very bad <unk> and bad <unk> .
now , you 've gone up with this <unk> , and that 's exactly the same number of <unk> attacks only had to come in .
they do n't have to eat anything , they have so much eaten .
and these progression dynamics of lawsuits and healthy , and it has no <unk> .
even though they were <unk> <unk> .
they both ate a lot .
one of them and the other healthy .
so what happens ?
it becomes a process called <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
whenever they take organisms or cells and cells take away the organism to take away in the cell or injured entities , to do it again .
that makes sense .
and that looks like .
you can see how in the cell , you can see , in the cell , are mainly in the cell , in order to fall during the age of the age .
and then the <unk> then transmits the constituents on the tube and the cell <unk> again .
this is what they 're in the ancient face of the brain in boundaries .
that 's the molecular <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> of the cholera numbers
so , to put it into a range of things that makes life in various organisms .
and it 's likely to do something that works with people .
and we 're learning that they 're not going to do the same thing in <unk> , you want to fight 20 ,
no .
it 's what you 're saying when they have hunger , ah , maybe it 's going to be <unk> .
mind your hunger like a friend .
and that makes some reflective sense .
now , at the end of nine percent of human history , the person who had hunger ?
right , he 's gone .
we go to the refrigerator when we have hungry .
and that 's safe to biology .
now , of course , we know , of course , and that 's already in the bible , in <unk> chapters , <unk> <unk> , who is willing to mind , but the dog is weak .
the garden looks very different from us .
here 's a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> garden .
the three main thing here is good , the food all day , let 's have signed .
and this is sort of the actual <unk> .
so we 've been looking at looking at the door that the molecular answer of the <unk> , even though the organism eats .
that could be interesting for people to be interesting to people whose <unk> <unk> not enough <unk> <unk> .
and it might be one of the hardest <unk> of life .
so the question is , is we harvest the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , even though you eat ?
and we have a lot of a hundred of a hundred , and we have a lot of a thousand , natural <unk> .
we have found one , which is called <unk> .
<unk> is a substance that is happening in all of our jobs , but it 's in all of the organisms in all organisms .
in the skin , it 's on the <unk> .
<unk> people have much less <unk> in the skin .
and if we 're spending yeast on human cells , for example , that 's what you see .
so that 's what 's going on here ,
and we 're seeing a lot of thousands of these little <unk> in the cell , and we 'll see a thousand of these little <unk> in the cell , which is in the age of the age , <unk> .
<unk> cells would just look like this .
and this works in all different organisms .
so , for example , here 's a <unk> .
so what we 've found is , we found that molecular <unk> <unk> <unk> .
life because the material is so longer .
and the answer is , again , you 're going to see the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> .
they 're very simple <unk> .
after a matter of days , the dead age , is roughly half dead .
whenever we put 180 to drinking water , here 's where the animals are getting older and survive .
we also know that human cells that we 're sending from <unk> <unk> <unk> , about three times as long as long as a result , if we put them with a <unk> .
and the latest research shows even close to the lives of the life of all due to the afterlife .
and it 's not just life , it 's also the <unk> .
these mice are totally <unk> .
so here .
now you all want to know , where 's going on ?
and as the name says , it 's been discovered in the sperm , it 's been discovered in the sperm ,
but i can also give it confirmation , also in <unk> , and a product from <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> , which is so <unk> <unk> from a lot of <unk> .
so we said , if you think about <unk> against <unk> , by using the kind of money that might possibly possibly be <unk> ?
you have to know that the common denominator of all venezuelan diseases is that during the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age , in the brain .
and we did some experiments .
you 're going to wonder , we have the ability to use things .
now this is what they 're going to do is when they 're old .
they have more <unk> in the brain when they 're old .
and the molecular mechanisms that are in memory is very similar to people .
now you still ask yourself , how does the guy have measured the memory of things ?
this is the experiment we 've done with several hundred pictures of the pittsburgh school .
you can take a hundred grains of fruit flies and you want a sound that you love .
<unk> .
and let 's see it in this <unk> .
and then you take the same fly , give them into the next chamber , and you give them some of the others smell you love , which you love is , which are <unk> .
let 's do it <unk> , but it <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
and then you take the same flying , do this , you know , the ones here .
the driving here goes down , you know , you see it .
and if they 're here down there , you 're going to give you on the one hand , and you 're <unk> about it .
so where do they all go ?
sure .
the <unk> .
except here .
these are the <unk> sites .
or , you have character .
i love my <unk> , and i 'm not going to do myself by <unk> .
okay .
but it 's the form of the character that is living with age .
not just with flying .
and we could actually eliminate the <unk> of the fly , through a <unk> , on a <unk> level .
and the <unk> <unk> that were in the brain were left again .
that 's what it means , <unk> does n't just be resistant to the ground , but also against foreign diseases , possibly .
and that 's important , because we do n't want to increase the quality of money .
it does n't make sense to prolong time the time .
and i do n't want to leave you , without giving you a couple of practical tips , we might be younger .
even more fast ,
it 's not that you 're going to reduce weight or so .
there 's a lot of time in austria in austria in austria , from <unk> people who ate a day and a day nothing .
that 's the so-called <unk> underneath the line of hollywood <unk> and strikes .
and they think very good .
that means , it 's <unk> .
do n't avoid it <unk> .
it 's not about conventional complex carbs , not being dangerous .
it 's really about candy .
you know , <unk> are sufficient to take diabetes , even when they 're in sync .
and you know that sugar can increase growth of tumors .
this is where they 're looking at <unk> , it 's <unk> .
after 30 days , they 're all dead .
it 's very low doses of glucose rich .
to create a <unk> effect .
there 's just one example that 's working in almost all of these things .
food is eating vegetables and vegetables .
and avoid the gift of too much <unk> or <unk> .
you know that <unk> -- and <unk> cancer .
that 's not under vitamin d for vitamin d .
we might be here in the winter , because vitamin d is going through sunlight on the skin .
some of them , at least three times per week , half over half , that 's trivial .
in spite of the year , two , they have <unk> 10 to three years .
if you do , you know , in times of the eternal <unk> , you have to feel like this .
the influence of pray and blood on life expectancy .
because of life , almost as women .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , living longer than <unk> .
<unk> living longer than <unk> .
but still <unk> life still more than <unk> .
only <unk> babies are used to die as a <unk> .
what is this ?
people assume that what happens to do with some of them .
no way .
now , a <unk> on the window , i 'm going to get it to <unk> <unk> .
and what you probably do is probably happening in your business .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> , and so what , they 're <unk> under the circumstances .
that 's why alcohol has <unk> effect .
an extraordinary partner , or a fixed partner with longevity .
they do n't want to live on a much longer place .
now you think about the same <unk> .
but that has nothing to do with <unk> .
it 's about <unk> .
you can measure your closer to a much more integrated street , the more <unk> he has in blood .
and that 's when he says , i used to do it .
i can just sleep well and the sound i do n't do .
it 's not true .
he still has more complex in the blood , and that 's bad .
so sunlight should be trafficked because of course , of course .
we now know that this is a very good number of effects .
especially , it can be <unk> .
and we also know that happiness and <unk> mice protect them against .
that ended up our grandmothers , and our grandmothers have been looking at <unk> and so forth .
it does n't make sense .
several studies came out that darkly chocolate against additional <unk> .
it 's just a beautiful trial that 's shown that there 's a 3,000 trial on the ranks of a <unk> .
and what you might think about coffee is that the most of the time , but it 's thinner .
there are studies that show there , there are studies that are not showing that .
what 's clear is that coffee is against diabetes , and so their metabolic metabolic function improves .
and then , of course , this is also a good tool because he solves <unk> <unk> from paris .
it 's very nice and a half trial in the hundred people , and it 's been shown in the hundred people , have been shown by the hundred of a handful of years , that people who are spending a handful of war every single day .
that 's an enormous value for the whole study .
and it 's for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
but not for peanuts , the <unk> of the <unk> have seen it .
the only thing about them nuts is , okay ?
but that 's actually a big deal .
so for you do n't care .
the next item is a little bit .
and it 's basically the shot of a lot of animal protein , which is from meat and <unk> , but only when they 're between <unk> and <unk> .
there 's a very beautiful new survey that you can see if they 're going to take a lot of animal protein , they 're spending your <unk> so strong than if they were a big treat .
that 's not for the time after animal proteins are good , and it does n't mean for children 's children or adolescents that need the water , and it 's not for pregnant and those who want it .
it 's generally , you know .
whatever you do , you do n't know what you 've heard of , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the
all of you heard about it in the rice industry .
this is the prime <unk> guy who has been about to this regime , and he 's <unk> years old .
it comes from my home from <unk> , it 's never sick .
and he goes very good .
he 's just not a strategist designer , but he lives in a <unk> , where there 's a lot of healthy dinosaurs .
it 's about the <unk> hype , which i told you today .
we should n't be familiar with all the <unk> experiments .
so , that 's the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , i ca n't even biological but it seems to be a <unk> , and it 's a <unk> .
you <unk> the old people less , and that may be one of our culture .
<unk> wrote the biggest novel in a year before his death .
the brothers <unk> .
one piece of service , especially the teenagers <unk> .
thank you for your attention .
i want to begin with a question that i 'm going to give you .
now , a question where now nobody have to get up to get up , because that 's a little more powerful who is lonely ?
the <unk> is very small .
less than i thought .
it 's probably probably reasons why they do n't have the same thing , even the people that would be <unk> .
lots of people are <unk> and loneliness , and thinking that would be <unk> .
that 's not the case .
now , surprisingly , burma is really more likely to be a phenomenon .
maybe it 's also that you 're not going to have , because the question is that the question is .
do you feel lonely or is you fake ?
you can feel lonely being being lonely .
and you can be lonely without being lonely .
now , loneliness also has a lot to do with shame .
and this is what some of the things here are now to give me a <unk> .
loneliness is going to shame and shame in loneliness .
i need a lot of a magician .
so now nobody will have shown here today , in the few seconds , i gave them .
so , loneliness needs a magician .
it takes time to get time to be conscious .
and loneliness also needs to talk about it .
and these practice do n't have done .
we do n't have the language for ourselves , when we 're lonely ?
there is two modes of <unk> that i 've always encountered .
one part of humanity says , you 're lonely .
from the birth to death , you 're just lonely .
there are few moments in the life where you can live .
these people are often going to <unk> and move all the day .
i do n't have time to do that .
and then people have less common , saying everything is connected to everything .
and i do n't think , well , i 'm just a part of the universe .
and there 's the big group of that i 'm also the time that 's like this .
they think , okay , i 'm lonely and the next day , oh , it 's all on each other .
if we think of loneliness , the very large poses , we 're going to think one .
the loneliness of the board , the <unk> of the marriages in a intensive care .
but over these <unk> , i 'm not going to talk to you today , but i want to talk about the small , i want to talk to you , but i want to talk about the small ones , where i can also give us in such a theater .
i do n't want to talk about burden and <unk> of the <unk> .
in other words , we do n't care hard to realize about nature 's disease .
the 1980s refused to bat has a couple of photos i want to show you .
as easy as it 's always going to discover in other words .
we all know whether these people really were lonely at this moment .
but who do n't know , at the moment , at the moment , in the <unk> event , where you think , everybody talk to each other , just a little lost in the corner , and he does n't have any squared .
all of a sudden , i 'm sorry , you know , everybody else .
maybe some of them have experienced this today .
what you 're doing is that you 're going to do the cell phone , so you could be very good at this very good , the <unk> , the <unk> of the cell <unk> .
clearly , if you look at your display .
what we do n't do here .
yes , and then there 's the loneliness that you 're looking at that , you know , the loneliness of a <unk> squid on a <unk> hundreds of <unk> faces , and you have a little left in hope that you do n't kick your text .
these are the <unk> that you see from the outside .
we ran other people .
but i 'm sure that there are people here in the room that are in the room that are in the room that are in the room that are in the room that are in the room that you feel in their own lives long as they 've tried to distract these loneliness .
and there 's also people who are lonely in this room because they have to remove their own , because of the separation .
there are nothing to do that , so many people , even people who are connected with them , they feel lonely .
and there are people who do n't find the transition to themselves , and they 're lonely .
i 'm calling the digital charts .
and leave you to give you the machine machine .
the video games is familiar with us .
these are people who think they 're looking for social contacts .
there 's always been relative .
there 's no one number that no longer number when someone else has enough human capacity , when they do n't .
we 're looking at that old people immediately .
it 's the <unk> form of loneliness .
but then we all in cities live in cities with lots of thousands or facebook or facebook or facebook or facebook or facebook or facebook or facebook or facebook or facebook or facebook or facebook or facebook or facebook or facebook or facebook or facebook or facebook or facebook or facebook or facebook or facebook or facebook or facebook or facebook or facebook or facebook , these
you can be connected to hundreds of people being connected without a single person .
it 's in its analog assessment of human relationships that are lacking in the digital settlement .
the two forms of loneliness is going to be very often <unk> .
and that 's true of the <unk> of a little bit of <unk> .
whereas digital loneliness is good for <unk> and <unk> .
it 's what makes you think about digital comparisons in the future , when the possibilities of connect to connect , to connect .
i do n't know if you 're going to be very similar to be very similar to be very similar to be very similar to this ,
or if you 're going to find a new word .
but that 's also the problems of the infinite generation .
almost greater than the loneliness self is fear , the fear of loneliness , and from this fear of loneliness , people are doing some things to do .
<unk> , the big <unk> , even a <unk> , a wonderful <unk> .
you know , what people do everything to do is not alone .
they build cathedrals , they build the witnesses that they 're lonely and they 're lonely .
but it 's not won the fear of loneliness in order to spend money .
`` okay . ''
things sound .
both of the process , in the solomon , because it 's at least making a touch , and the items themselves that you have had .
the problem is just that it 's going to be helping and embrace this one <unk> against loneliness .
so we have to get new things back to new things .
so i 've seen the advertising for a <unk> of <unk> .
and the <unk> of all the time with the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea , some of it was happening .
which is what it has to do is , you know , but apparently it works .
so loneliness has nothing to do with the wholesale to do things that do n't happen for people .
<unk> <unk> has written a wonderful poem , and there 's a <unk> , but at the worst , he 's loneliness .
hand on the heart , who does n't know ?
in a relationship , you know , in a relationship , or to look at the other thing as a <unk> and feel terrible about feeling terrible lonely and ask a question of asking who is this person ?
so , did i do something to do ?
one study told that the <unk> women in the ages of women are getting married , with kids feel .
it 's filling out because i do n't know that i do n't know if i study the study that i told you .
but it 's also not really true because it 's at least in clinical studies , and the reaction is always the same thing that the people 's front before me .
that intuitive is so totally granted , almost a <unk> .
i do n't want to talk about it , and yet , we 're talking about them .
talk about the loneliness to sex .
and that 's probably what everybody had .
now , while you 've been building <unk> , suddenly , what do i do ?
who is this person in my bed ?
and that 's the form of loneliness that not necessarily have to do with the quality of the sexual .
there 's nothing needs to do with the quality of relationship .
she 's just there .
we do n't talk about them , because we do n't look at it .
we 're not talking about them in the workforce .
in the workforce , the loneliness is loneliness as we think .
i was <unk> on such square <unk> , and there 's a group of five <unk> , better , three juvenile suit and two profiles .
both men have been engaged , both women have been engaged in the classroom .
and in between , something <unk> , something <unk> with the spine of the <unk> .
i mean , i 'm not going to do the scene on this kind of <unk> that everybody else has ever seen in his career .
it 's the loneliness of the <unk> .
it 's also the loneliness of consciousness .
we all know the <unk> or i see , here might be some of your life behaving .
in <unk> , in <unk> in the hotels , in the '50s , no often do n't know who they 're doing .
where they are .
and this is a form of loneliness that 's not spoken .
it 's also known as loneliness as <unk> .
that 's what it 's wrong here .
i 've told you an <unk> told that he was calling by a client , and he said , it 's what 's happening on , you can not imagine you .
it was a <unk> in the lunchroom .
so he 's <unk> himself .
and two months later , he 's also hired .
and the loneliness is never alone .
it 's always coming in playing with other feelings .
she has beautiful siblings , and she 's got ugly siblings .
the real one , we all know .
fear , sad , anger and shame .
but we should n't forget the good milk .
the freedom of the freedom that the hell of the desire .
that 's why my <unk> look at me .
come in and the <unk> and the tide .
let 's take them , and let 's not do it .
because there 's something much worse than the loneliness , and that 's the empty you might have to come to the paralyzed .
burma is part of life .
and since i 've been thinking about loneliness , i have changed two things .
so in my <unk> ceremony , i did n't think about the <unk> dictator since i 've ever realized , i 'm going to tell you why he 's not going to have the people , maybe i am lonely .
i 've been able to do it since , i since i have to come to my own lives , people come and go .
that 's what it 's like with the lyric that you do .
and i 've become free .
people get to go and go , they 're not going to move forward to the ticket , whether they could n't get a friendship and a lot of a partnership .
as a child , i found my parents incredibly embarrassing .
they ca n't come to a conversation with somebody else .
whether the diy or the economy .
each time led to have a universal conversation .
as a child , i found that what i found .
and as a young age , i was an adult journalist to have this openness .
but only since i 've been obsessed with loneliness , i was going to get it up at least , and i would also open myself up .
you 're going to be lonely , you know , you 're ready for the next performance .
thank you very much .
yes , thank you very much .
i 've got one three notes here .
a <unk> and a <unk> .
and now , let me just have access to you if you 've got this issue ?
most of the people would decide for the <unk> .
and that 's a really good idea .
and why ?
because we make effort to make this with a complete effort .
in fact , in fact , we 're doing something different .
and we let the biggest effect on the top effect on top of it , and we 're going to choose to the other strategies .
we decide for example , and that 's in sports for sports .
big <unk> but big effort .
for me , not so valuable .
or we 're going to decide to the <unk> .
it 's for diet .
there 's still very big effort .
for me , not so valuable .
and i want to share with you today to tell you how to make the most effort ,
if you 're dealing with prevention and health , you do n't want to look at a topic .
and that 's what makes you say .
and this topic , it was n't a topic in germany , so that 's about all the way to the <unk> .
and then the number of <unk> in germany are strong .
and i asked myself , what was there going on ?
so why did n't this go up to the top ?
and then i did research , and i also have upgraded .
because it was done in the years .
what was there ?
there was <unk> in germany .
and we 're always going to be and emergence ?
and i went on .
<unk> comes up to germany .
and that 's what 's going on .
and in the years , the curve takes a look at the ride .
and then what happens to germany ?
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and the way that it means .
and we 're always going to be and emergence ?
well , i got one and one .
because it was clear .
sports is dick .
and of course , i 'm not here today to tell you that sports is dick .
because that 's not true .
but one of us have found in common .
the deluge of always new school -- and <unk> is not led to us and healthier .
so what is it ?
the diet ?
and there 's really amazing trial from the states of the states .
the problem with obesity .
and they 've gone into the <unk> economy .
and then she wanted to look at a little bit , what is happening ?
and you 've seen that people are still less fat on but the people still hold more calories , but still breathe .
and that was the paradox .
and that 's why they 're called <unk> .
so we can explain that ?
and you can think like a power station .
so here we have this big <unk> .
and on the one hand , there 's a <unk> , because there 's something we put all the <unk> on it , which are burned here .
and here 's the energy as a power .
but if we 're spending more <unk> here in our power than we use the energy on the power and it 's bang .
the human body does not matter by the same .
it can store the energy .
and it 's in the form of fat .
our greatest and <unk> <unk> .
but what happens then when we 've heard less like we 've heard , energy , and yet we <unk> the energy here , the energy , the energy , the energy , it just leaves one .
the <unk> area has increased .
there 's no life going on .
we 're just <unk> .
and that 's exactly what happens .
our grandparents went to go to 20 miles .
and what we 're now today today is one to two miles and that are the positive estimates .
there are studies that report from five -- to <unk> feet .
i 'm going to tell you a little bit with my friend , mike .
you just want to tell me about the chair ?
mike , do you have a degree ?
mike is american .
he 's shy , he 's not going to talk much .
and he was in this trial , and now here is now .
he 's this typical <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and he has a <unk> in the hand .
and mike 's getting less and less and less , and yet , he 'll still get thicker .
why ?
because mike only is still sitting .
and i was looking around , like a lot of motion , a day , and he would give him a step back in the bag , and the evening i did .
and there 's a thousand steps .
so this was the distance , mike <unk> , in the car with the car in the car with the car , of course , a little bit of coffee , and then again .
and he came to a thousand moments .
that means mike 's on his legs 10 minutes .
<unk> hours and a half minutes , he said , `` he was mike .
under that condition , a disease from itself .
and mike will not be breathing , because he 's getting too much better , because he gets to the end up to the end of it , and he 's always used to get thicker and the energy <unk> .
and first of all , the energy here is the energy you can see here at his <unk> .
but energy is <unk> that stays there .
and then they 're going back to the <unk> , back in <unk> blood .
and again , she 's active and <unk> and quiet and quiet .
so the blood flow .
so when you look into the energy inside the blood , the doctors are going to talk to the <unk> and high .
and this <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , does small holes in these <unk> .
and a happily restaurant , because the whole fat of all the time , and then you put it on these little wounds , and we talk about <unk> or <unk> .
now , <unk> heart is right under pressure , because now it 's got the blood flowing through these narrow <unk> effort , and we 're talking about high blood pressure .
and when this kind of nodded hits it , then it 's going to sound in the body .
and if it 's at heart , we call the heart attack .
and if that 's what we call the stroke .
and also in germany , every second of heart ,
that is , in germany , every second of <unk> .
and then , it 's not so sick because he does n't have any sports but it does n't happen to do it .
and if you do n't know these things , you 'll just look at the wrong place .
for example , <unk> .
and i was still ready to have sex in the amazon , and there 's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and if every book only is just a centimeter thick , and we would like this , you would have a 30 meters of <unk> <unk> .
and i 've read it for you .
and it 's inside , and this is actually important as you 're going to eat more energy than they 're doing .
and if you take less energy than you are , they 're getting <unk> .
that 's brilliant .
but why do we need <unk> books ?
it 's just one end .
the need is , of course , is a huge problem that is not help .
because why does a diet a hundred percent ?
because it 's a diet , and not a lifestyle .
what are the things that we 're doing here three weeks ago , and here 's five weeks when we go back after that , back to the normal life , to our normal lifestyle .
so what do you think of five or seven weeks ?
nothing .
but again , and again , a <unk> in the confidence that we did n't have done what we 've done .
so you 're allowed to have a new diet with every new diet , in every new <unk> questions , and you want to integrate it in your daily lives .
yes or no ?
and then , when it 's shaking .
and if you just keep it .
because when it comes out of the end , it 's really pure time .
these are the habits that are going to decide about whether we are getting sick or healthy .
it 's the bad habits that are attracted to us .
and it 's the good habits that make us healthy .
and when you look at the mirror , it 's the result of his everyday lifestyle .
if you look at it in the mirror , you can see his daily habits .
and when you look at it in the mirror , and you 're honest , he 's where it 's on the road .
because if he 's more bad habits more bad habits , he 's just in the direction of disease .
and when mike in the direction of health , his dreams , he does n't get his whole life .
then he just need more good habits than bad .
and a <unk> , mike , gives you a great example of that the person is already a strange animal .
mike has done , for example , is fully made out of its daily lifestyle by transferring any way to the car with a violin , every tap .
and at the evening , he 's sitting at the couch , and you have to somehow get into movement again .
so he goes into his front of the cracks , and he sits on the hook up , and it becomes a <unk> band , so it somehow comes back to motion .
and my grandpa would have been as ecologically as they were .
that was the farmer , and did n't understand that .
it would have been said , sports is to people who do n't move .
and somehow he 's right .
why do we have to do the same thing in front of us , and what we 've been discussing in the day of the day ?
but in fact , we 'd have to spend two hours a day today .
in fact , it 's a lot easier to get there where we lost it .
in life .
and that 's why i 'm going to invite you today to you today .
and you might know the situation you 're going to jump back to the kaaba , and that 's where there 's no place in the first range .
and that 's what you see , like , what is this <unk> in us .
we always want to go to the creative routes .
we 're planning our homes so that we have the <unk> possible .
we 're planning our whole life that we do n't have the most advanced way of the world , but that does n't lead us to where we <unk> .
it 's in a different direction .
that 's why you 're allowed to activate the dopamine message , and the movement will find out where they are .
i 'll like to jump out of the video to the present .
and i 'm the only one who always comes up and down and forth and the whole other .
but if i 'm there more , i have the time for me .
and then i 'm going to push the movement that just lies like this .
and when from the top half of the <unk> come , 30 minutes , says , `` i <unk> . ''
<unk> steps .
that 's about three times 10 minutes .
and a <unk> <unk> , and if you 're going to have a day today every day today , that they 're not 12 missiles on your body .
now , you know , that might sound pretty much .
but as a <unk> , a habit began to talk to us talk about four degrees five pounds of calories .
we do n't have our bodies .
and you 'll give me on this , and i <unk> him for him .
the americans are nuts , they 're nuts .
this is a <unk> from five pounds of fat .
they are four kilos .
just so you can see what happens with these little things .
and if the effect is from this perspective , what i think is what 's going on , if you really start in a collaborative life .
and this faucet , they 're going to get over a day today every day .
and as soon as you 've gone from <unk> steps per day , they 'll walk close to everybody else .
and if you feel like that , and then they 're going to do that on the ground .
and then they 're still <unk> them on top .
then you 'll still get faster and stronger .
but they do n't make their health to sports .
they do n't care about their health , and from your time .
because the most important thing about this is the most important thing that the most important you can do now .
and i <unk> `` an active lifestyle . ''
and for me , it 's more than a lifestyle , for me , it 's a <unk> that makes a clear choice in life and for me .
because i believe health does n't have to do what we should be doing .
but health has to do what we want to do .
and so now , i 'm just one idea for you .
they 're just going to be one for the best one days .
and by now , you know what it is .
step forward .
thank you very much .
now , how did it have a leonardo killer of vinci , some of the way to see the world in other eyes ?
and so , even so far on the amount of what happened at his time , was futile ?
so would we even have this today ?
did n't it be what to do with ?
and how can we draw the force and confidence for our future ?
let 's start with the question with the question with the question with the question with the question of innovation ?
sure .
technology is r & amp and d , even the other federal government 's title , the title of the federal government .
so , understand me .
that 's all wonderful .
and we can be quite proud of that , and it 's grateful for us to be grateful in these fields to the world that it 's very good for us .
that we have so extraordinary , unique prosperity .
but what about the future ?
so , what are the challenges that are being there to be a society ?
and who cares , because of the major environmental and social challenges ?
so it seems to be a kind of job .
a kind of a loop .
so the economy is to restore the ecological challenges , because of the entrepreneurs that the entrepreneurs are getting great effort to we get productivity and efficiency .
and the world are getting better , they want to find themselves in criminal organizations and then , and then , and then , and then they have to look at the company , and then what companies are , of course , to avoid the <unk> economy .
at least , at least .
but who says that we need to look at this as a result of that as you can look like this .
now , what if we push biologic <unk> to create social and cultural development ?
if technologies are also cultural innovations ?
if economic innovation is also social innovations ?
so if we think about what we think about , and how do we have to get into account with the solution of big , social challenges ?
if all of these , if all of this , if all of these unknown forces , and if there is a very different approach to design design development ?
because what was that ?
they want to do the pages , right ?
can we do that ?
you may be wondering .
so far , we have always been <unk> .
luckily , there is some basic examples .
fourteen yunus did with his <unk> , with his temples in bangladesh , in bangladesh , in bangladesh , in bangladesh , in bangladesh , in bangladesh , on poverty .
and interestingly , much more generally at the direct level of what the government have been <unk> .
and he has <unk> as a entrepreneur , presumably found this <unk> <unk> .
in the occasion , there 's one thing i 'm going to be familiar with you .
we can imagine <unk> <unk> .
now , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
all of that , but it did have its ideals as well .
and yeah , so totally <unk> .
i like the totally love .
and if you see that , you think , well , you know , when you think , we do n't worry about our future .
yes , the moment he did he started to work somewhere here with one of our <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that 's what he does .
and that 's very successful in it .
and yet something is happening here .
so he 's saying there 's no more thing to do it ?
this is what he always does .
<unk> are <unk> in all the games .
and you like that .
and he also like this <unk> .
so the right thing is , as it 's the <unk> , it 's actually realized .
so he 's not that he knows him , but that 's what he said , but that 's what he said .
and in the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the t , he did n't know .
so even the way he was introduced to the <unk> personal presentation .
<unk> <unk> .
and as an <unk> entrepreneur , he realized there .
so , when it 's great joy , so with young people , to begin with his experience .
and then the two people would have found it .
and they 've been struck .
now , what if we just talk about this interview from the two ?
yes , mister <unk> , like , that 's what it was .
so what is exactly the difference between the conservation sector and the <unk> enterprise ?
i did n't understand that .
yes , so then you 're starting to do that question , what is unmanned <unk> ?
so he said yes .
local markets , agricultural products , lots of customer , <unk> structures , there 's a <unk> .
and you can also be able to add one of the big shapes that you can do .
and once again , <unk> , even though the whole thing is , again , it 's too much .
so what is a <unk> ?
so , you know , you 've got a lot of times lying not the little copy of a big company .
it 's something very different .
it has a completely different characters .
because it does n't stop anything .
there 's no such thing , no <unk> <unk> , nothing .
so , of course , a <unk> organization is a <unk> organization to look at the business business model , which is the profitable fuel , of course , is that , of course , is that , of course , and then it 's scale .
and you 're certain understanding that there are , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , in such a different ways , there 's other ways of magnitude , very different ways .
yes , that 's what i 'm clear .
but what are we looking for ?
so , i 'm going to do it , then , you know , how did i want to earn money ?
so i have a degree , this fits all right , so you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , in berlin , berlin ?
that 's called <unk> .
you know , your businesses have been successful in the same time you have <unk> your life .
oh , no .
that 's real <unk> ?
what do you think , if you 're going to get 30 , 30 your little money , what ?
so then you put a career as a practical <unk> or what ?
what happens to your commitment , so i know you know ?
and we also have a look at a time , and we have a look at a minute .
so the statistics do n't give you a <unk> perspective , because 70 percent of all of the steamy are a few years in a much more powerful financial situation than you get here .
money is always the result of a successful enterprise and a temporary business company .
yeah , money is a resource for public care .
and it 's the basis , it 's all economic growth .
but it 's never the goal of a company .
yes , what is the target ?
the company ?
so , when i do what i do is , i do n't have to do it , so it 's not the right way of the right .
and so , you know , it 's going to be <unk> and so on .
and if i do n't have it , so i can not know what i 'm looking for ?
so i do n't think good emotion .
so i want to decide because there and risks and risks , that feels like me and <unk> .
yes , welcome to the <unk> .
but i do n't know what to you .
a thread .
so this is <unk> , so it 's almost classified .
successful years generation
a <unk> tool for <unk> .
so , how do you do today ?
<unk> , do i <unk> ?
so we 're always saying , well , do n't push up .
by comparison , the <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
so , it helps .
i mean , i can leave you one of them .
okay .
yes , thank you , mister <unk> .
but there are just questions on it .
you know , you know , you know , you know , one of the major public companies are good questions .
can we get the other point of the other , that i can think that better ?
so the first thing is , what am i trying to get here and do it ?
yes , <unk> , there 's what 's going on with you , which is bigger than you do ?
what are you looking at the world ?
what are people doing when they work together ?
what are you ready to give ?
what are your inside , maybe even unconscious ?
why is this so important to identify ?
because these are also your current <unk> .
and how did we learn that by learned ?
if you do a ship you want to do the men together , and then you 're going to do a ship , and then you 're going to make a ship in edinburgh , but you teach me , you know , to the extent , is the sea .
yes , good .
so i looked at the next questions .
what is my jet <unk> ?
what is that ?
yes , now , you know , you 've got your target on your target .
you know , they worked in detail , whenever it 's but i <unk> you in front of you in front of you , you know , what you do n't want to get to you .
you really know the story with the pink <unk> ?
it 's close to me .
not ?
<unk> .
so , look at .
if you do n't have <unk> elephants .
okay ?
would it be ?
so there 's no pink elephant .
pardon ?
we do n't have <unk> elephants .
you see ?
that 's what we want to focus on what we want .
so what is the only chance that ?
i mean , there 's <unk> ?
yeah , you know what you want .
so , <unk> <unk> , or maybe the <unk> on the grass .
but think about you .
by the way , what i 'm going to do is , you know , <unk> ?
i have a cop there .
now , you know , when you get the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> smith smith .
anyone ?
at least , <unk> , <unk> , what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i 'm <unk> <unk> from you to give back to <unk> the time to the time in the time , <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> the glass of the glass .
i did what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i like what <unk> my <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> smith .
oh , you know , is <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
it 's like <unk> <unk> <unk> 's <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> from <unk> .
it 's a <unk> of <unk> .
the real <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
and then <unk> what is it ?
did you notice what ?
did anything be changed ?
okay .
okay , and the flower too .
okay .
so then we look at where the bear has arrived .
and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> smith smith .
anyone ?
at least , <unk> , <unk> , what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i 'm going to <unk> <unk> from you to <unk> the time to <unk> the time in the time .
i <unk> the glass of the glass .
i did what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i like what <unk> my <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> smith .
and <unk> , what is you doing this ?
so i know , i was also shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i first saw it .
i could n't think it was n't .
and even more shocked , i was going to be myself as myself through my head , so it could be that the whole time in the area ?
by my life .
and okay , i understand , i think , is totally sense .
in order to prevent the immediate <unk> that we have to do most of our perception and our <unk> days .
now , what is this ?
what do i mean ?
and therefore , you know , you 're looking at your perception of your perception , is another important entrepreneurial quality .
well , yeah , so , thank you , so we 'll move next to the next question .
so how could i be here to my goal ?
so that 's what i think is good .
and the reason i 'm going to do is , and you do n't even know anything .
yes , <unk> , there 's good news for you .
this will fall easier than you know that .
because if you 're clear to you , your inner drive , and if you 're going to tell you , you know , you know , you know , you know , it 's going to happen in the inside of itself .
almost automatically .
you 're not going to be able to be able to do anything that you 're going to be a brainstorming in your mind .
these are the famous <unk> you had in the shower .
and i 'm going to tell you , you know , what i 'm going to look at this question , i 'm going to look at who you could look at who you could think about , you know , to be able to get your home .
and you have a big role too .
the <unk> have this been terrific .
<unk> di <unk> , if he did n't know more further , he has invited me to florence his <unk> tales .
for lunch to the famous table .
and it 's totally different people .
so scientists , <unk> , politician , politicians , bankers engineers , the architect , and he got very intense <unk> .
but not in our present senses , where 's the time , yes , who makes you ?
who 's right ?
but in fact , a lot of these different things come out of these different things that no way of which would have happened in their own .
well , the next question is , what is the next question , what 's i doing ?
so you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the successful entrepreneur in the cause is very simple .
instead of doing big and management and so on just on the next step .
because what do you want to do in uncertainty ?
but that 's what people are doing this very , very sophisticated and with all the consequence .
and if there was nothing to be , you have to look at some other time .
and even when the great world 's large , they were n't going to have anything else on the shoes .
so it 's so important that you 're clear .
that gives you the intrinsic security .
and in the rest of the world , we learned all to work ?
even though we did n't know that , and there 's no one ?
well , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , too ,
so , this particular game is learning this search and this timeless dictum , it 's as fun as a company in a company .
and that 's exactly the same thing that the uncertainty of the uncertainty that otherwise else does .
yes , mister <unk> .
so that sounds pretty neat about this .
but i do n't know , at me , in the company , i do n't know , you have to change a lot of career , there 's something happening .
and for the sake of germany , there 's always such as these common <unk> .
and i mean , you know , the politicians were concerned that changes .
okay , so okay , my boy , come on .
you go to the water here .
what do you think , how many people are you ?
ten ?
tens of thousands ?
ten million ?
look down here .
who are you ?
that 's exactly what it 's .
so that 's what you can do is really change .
or to tell you with mahatma <unk> , the change you look in the world is looking at you in the world .
do you think about beautiful words and great role models , but how does that work work ?
and we have a very <unk> , to the right , some of our <unk> on our <unk> .
so helpful in all kinds of crises , or if you want to make you too small , or if you have a <unk> , and you all have to do with you .
and if you ask yourself in these sorts of ways , what 's very <unk> you now , you can feel physically physically , you know .
so , if you look at what you like to you , you 're just <unk> .
and regardless of the end , you know , what you 're actually from this crisis or what 's happening .
so i mean , if you 've happened to it .
yeah , good .
thank you very much .
and do you really believe that this is going to happen on my way ?
yes , exactly .
and notice you two things .
first of all , <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , that 's going to your pacemaker .
because that means your perception .
and for the second , on your inner orientation , you can do it yourself .
because the other people , you 're going to behave with your behavior .
the future is , then , then we 're just going to change our own perception .
do you want to do that ?
yes , i do n't think .
and thank you mister <unk> .
everything 's good news <unk> .
yes .
what do you think about this ?
nice .
do n't , or , <unk> ?
and how do we think of it , is this <unk> ?
is this a new <unk> ?
i mean , yes .
all right .
what i see is the most vulnerable .
<unk> is <unk> .
and that 's what the really <unk> really is .
it 's an <unk> from the league of the <unk> .
and no , so new <unk> , <unk> .
this is the <unk> .
the only place , for a long time , a lot of the great famous names .
from robert <unk> , over <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
let 's just <unk> this spirit .
and who knows , it 's going to be out of our publication of our time .
they 're right , i 'm <unk> .
so maybe it would be intuitive to me with children and their future , and finally , the future , the future , the future .
instead , that 's what i 'm doing most of the time .
i spent a lot of my life in prison .
four years ago , my dad and i posted the program , entrepreneurship for prisoners , and started .
we genetically engineer <unk> <unk> , that 's what you can either do you want to do , or you can find yourself a 401 workplace that you can feel .
so why am i looking for <unk> , so those who did have the big mistake ?
our program is far less understanding how to make children care .
and i would have thought that the <unk> was the last place in the universe i would work .
what do you think , is the most important application of childhood with the people that we work with ?
we 've found that these are positive role models are often male positive models .
and when you think about it , why it 's so many of <unk> and many of them have gone over there , it 's because it 's because it 's because it 's because of the dad who 's using drugs or that he 's sitting in jail .
and when a liberating boy believes what he wants to think about his life is not a better idea of how a different life could be because he could n't have any role role models .
and he <unk> his father .
i 'll give you martin .
martin is <unk> of our program .
his father was an alcoholic , and he made the lives of hell .
when he was 12 , his mother died , and he had to go to the home .
there he was the <unk> of the great .
he was shy , and he <unk> and therefore the perfect victim .
as a result , as a result , as a result , as a brother had been <unk> , that 's the ground .
and then , in martin , with martin 's <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , he went to somebody and proposed .
and by that day , he was getting out .
and so it was coming .
now , in fact , the force was to his life as his father .
so , how do you know that i just described , continue ?
after childhood , you have a childhood , a lot of unemployed or have <unk> .
they do n't know much different than your illegal activity and their pioneering <unk> .
and then you 'll leave one day with people in jail , with people in jail in jail , they 're going to go through the same thing that no longer do n't make any role models .
over what , you think , think of these people , if you 're sitting in jail ?
all of that is not a lot of good .
and they 're better living in the <unk> .
they sell drugs to a higher level , and planning to the store where they could roll the store .
and that leads to 100 percent of <unk> percent .
that is , in germany , every country will go back in germany .
then there is also people in prison who want to change .
but also these people carry a mobile phone .
and there 's <unk> .
and everywhere you come , it 's your first identity .
whether they 're looking at a workplace , whether you want to make new private relationships , they want to build new private relationships , and they 're going to be able to do this with that <unk> , who will give you a way into society as infinitely difficult .
that 's the problem .
how do we try to fix this problem ?
what do you think , is a lot of <unk> ?
they 're going to be surprised .
they 're <unk> abilities .
you 've got a <unk> system , you 've got bored by <unk> , from <unk> and <unk> .
the only thing about the topic , it 's got a little bit alien , otherwise he would not get in jail .
these things we want to use for something positive .
we 're starting our program with a comprehensive education system in jail , in prison ,
we transmit the basics of entrepreneurship and economics .
everybody 's writing his own contradiction , and everyone takes a comprehensive <unk> part of it .
and then we 're going to talk to the people in the canopy , with the <unk> of their personal relationships and also in a variety of detail .
so , what are we going on from our program ?
it 's a big bandwidth , from the <unk> , for conservation .
we 've got a <unk> back to a <unk> .
now , a very large range and a lot of <unk> , i would like to give you a little bit of war .
<unk> <unk> talent and his illusion of fast money , has been very early in trade with disease .
he had fun to do business .
he 's been arrested for the first time .
and this lady has not been particularly strange .
true of the opposite .
he 's telling you , he 's got his second job .
<unk> , he had a second time .
he then took a therapy of a therapy and then the <unk> .
and there he learned how to use his local talent for anything .
he 's been released in september india , and then came to his bones for <unk> .
the agency 's good , it can now live .
he has a very good <unk> .
he 's up with me here today .
and who likes to talk to you for him .
one time back to martin , that i had told him .
martin has a new training for his childhood , and ended up in his <unk> <unk> .
and there were pollution and drugs that there is really pretty quickly .
he was working together as a <unk> and <unk> .
20 years he did this life .
and he 's telling you that he did not have a <unk> with this lifestyle .
and one day he would have a guy with someone who was being scanned .
and he had a <unk> , and the <unk> in it has changed his life .
and he learned how to make more force , and then more quality of life could not be able to consume his stop without drugs .
and he was made by his passion so he was so excited he 'd like to convey this .
and he wanted to be part of the <unk> .
that 's what it did .
he 's now going to change two years from us and <unk> our participants in the direction of freedom , because he knows that if you really want to change , and if you really want to change the right tools with the hand , that much more possible than you have to do .
the basis of these successes are the people that they are .
people who come to the people who come to the people who come to the participants in their own participants with their personal action .
these are our <unk> that we think of data in our schools are students who are doing the most vulnerable , <unk> of <unk> .
and these are our mentors that our participants are directly looking at right after the time .
and these people take a lot from our program .
one example .
we 're doing a exercise called <unk> .
we then put it in the middle of the room , we 're going to give us to stand on one of our participants , and we 're standing on the other side .
and i 'm going to ask different questions .
and every time in the room , if you answer this question , he 's looking at the line .
and here is what we all have in common is whether we 're sitting inside of prison or outside .
but also , where the difference are .
and one of the things that we care is that 's why .
i grew up in a so-called social event , or i had been a painting what was in custody of it .
there 's many of our participants going on the line and just very few of our cups .
one question i like to ask us all together , the <unk> , i want to ask you .
and i 'm going to ask you all up .
maybe we can get a little light in the audience .
i can see them .
they all get .
terrific .
thank you very much .
and i said , `` you know , a question , and if you 're going to go back this question , you 're going to stay otherwise .
that 's kind of our line that we are now .
i 've done , in my life , i did n't have professional things for that i could have been sick .
if you 're asking this question , please , please .
to be operational .
and then , of course , little full of them were obsessed with .
so to count it with the driver 's not really taken .
okay .
and it 's also happening , perhaps any workforce , it 's really really good to have gone .
all right .
most of them .
we have some angels in the room .
that 's wonderful , because i 'm happy .
thank you very much , they 're allowed to throw rid of them .
in this question , if we ask them on the site , we 'll get a lot of them in the way .
and i 'm also clear how much luck you have had .
happiness with the parents , happiness with the environment that they were growing up with the friends , but also , you may not always have been caught in the edge of the <unk> or too .
what are the results of that work ?
<unk> percent of our students can find a workplace .
that 's rapidly fast .
<unk> percent have already made them .
one-third of the donors are <unk> .
and our <unk> is seven percent .
i 've been told the <unk> of seven percent in germany percent .
i 'm <unk> .
a $ <unk> trillion dollar a year .
and it 's a beautiful <unk> , <unk> , which has a <unk> of seven percent of the <unk> of <unk> percent for a <unk> .
and as my dad and i have started to have started this together , we have been open from pretty much a lot of attention .
i used to be my fancy <unk> in a big corporation .
but i have to tell you , i did n't have a professional job in my life .
we 're encouraging our participants to take responsibility .
the responsibility of what happened in your life is , in your life , it 's making responsibility in your life .
they do n't hide , nothing too .
because this leads to a whole new self and allows it to trust .
and that 's why it makes me feel particularly happy and proud of our participants .
so that 's what i brought you with a little video .
`` movie , ''
so i went to two and eight months because of dangerous <unk> .
i was going to be interested in the <unk> against the <unk> to three and 10 months .
i traded it .
so , i 've driven a judgment of two years because dangerous <unk> .
i was convicted of <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
so , through my own adolescence , my life has changed my life .
and what was important for me , these were also made it .
because it was my absolute <unk> .
i was n't uncommon , i was almost saying , yes .
i 've got to do it again .
and i discovered again , again , i looked back again .
and you go with a very different awareness and self-awareness from the gun .
so , in fact , it was a lot of <unk> without fixed goals and then you 're going to stop again in anything .
with the wrong people , and that 's not happening now .
well , the problem is that a lot of people have a <unk> , if the ones are .
the biggest problem is , because then you get back to the old rock .
you do n't know anything else .
and through this surreal world , if you do n't care what 's going on with me , and i just think of myself in the way of thinking about the relationship with problems , about innovating , about innovating , which has gone from me just during this short weeks .
i 've been enjoying from my first wife from my first female .
and for example , six months ago , i signed up with her together .
so that means we have a new relationship .
and because i 'm going to make myself under some of these things , and many other things have changed .
i 've achieved a lot .
i 'm going to talk to my family in the world 's education .
so i 'm still working today in my job , i 'm going to say .
i 'm doing a <unk> externality for ballroom dancing .
you really have to realize that it 's very , very many people who are in fact , like my own time , and really , of course , i do n't know how attentive rules out of people .
and i 'm grateful for you to have come to the idea that they do so .
and i 'm grateful for you to have trouble in trouble , and i 'm extremely grateful that i was part of that .
of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , the whole thing that we were .
so i 've talked to a lot of people at the front of the camera , and they 've made it back , that 's good .
and that 's why i 'm doing it .
and for that , i thank you .
come to jail with us .
each one of them has something that we need .
whether they helped our participants at their participants , if they 're helping us as the <unk> , they 're going to be in a financial support .
whether they want to carry our program into a new paradigm , really <unk> .
talk about us .
martin burns and i 'm here today .
and they 're very excited to you .
thank you very much .
<unk> , i took myself with <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> in nepal .
in a time i was a <unk> .
you do things like that .
they 're targeted for <unk> .
the <unk> .
it 's a sabbatical in the sudan .
there 's really a lot of options today that you can handle with <unk> .
just as you can handle it .
anyway , i was also <unk> .
and i work with my work and so forth with the <unk> .
i really have to talk about <unk> .
and not from real problems .
my problem was , <unk> , and i could rather be quite amazing as my life in 10 or 30 years .
it was <unk> .
and that <unk> , i found scary .
to express it , to express it .
i mean , i had a <unk> <unk> .
just as private .
i did n't know what i was going to go on the <unk> trip ?
you 're just comfortable with me ?
or what would i get my <unk> away ?
and look what it happened .
which then goes to me .
that was the idea .
i was <unk> in this era , <unk> <unk> .
i said .
the missionary thing was for me to even have the absolute <unk> .
you 're <unk> for free the world , in a very good hotels and <unk> the country in a very small way .
but occasionally , occasionally , problematic countries .
developing countries where we have nothing to see more , and say , as a result of villages , <unk> villages , even though they have nothing so lucky and joy .
right from these images and sophisticated lives , but it 's also true .
and that 's exactly me after a while .
i did n't know what i was doing .
to fly on .
and also , i found it a little bit more nerdy about a country that i really did n't know .
i wanted to change that .
i wanted to be right now .
to write <unk> paper .
and to get my personal interest .
how about countries are better ?
just by people living with people .
with people living at home .
not in the hotel .
by talking about challenges and interacting with the problems of people .
and by making it work .
at least , the answer i could give me this question .
and i wanted to do that .
and i wanted to make something a little bit about .
i wanted to make a contribution .
doing something good .
and that sense of me , in my career , in a sense , still further .
i 've been doing a lot in developing countries , but nepal has been really touched me .
by <unk> , there was a <unk> civil war , not only many orphans but many economic and social problems .
with a $ 1,000 percent of <unk> dollars , nepal 's 10-year-old of the poorest country in south asia .
and yet go to one of the other poorest world earth .
a quarter of the population lives below the line .
almost one-fifth of the population suffers from malnutrition .
forty percent of adults can not read and write .
all of these facts are related to many personal stories and experiences that i met on this journey in a time i was ready to change with changes .
i wanted to do something .
and i stood up to my return of nepal , i found out of nepal 's choice .
i quit my job .
and <unk> me in the aid .
and i 'm a short word of the answer that i 've been put on my application .
because she was just a <unk> .
it 's about a serious story about designing international computing companies .
and it 's not about a <unk> <unk> for a <unk> drone that would have to live in nepal 's life , and the gowanus slope of their search .
hi ?
anybody else ?
now my life was really serious and good .
at least i thought .
and this answer was a <unk> <unk> .
i was really quite straightforward .
and he said , `` of course , a fairly emotional response . ''
and luckily , never <unk> .
instead , i took this thing to do good <unk> .
i used it as a motor to become my own business .
<unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and a company that is exactly what i was looking at then .
that 's the possibility to start a country differently .
the possibility to get a country right .
and i can think about how to live with the people , and work in space .
and it 's not somewhere that can work , but it 's called <unk> .
and then you can get into two words like this .
so , <unk> and <unk> .
that means , as well as location , that you can gather good use .
you can do good .
now , this sounds a little bit familiar with this stuff .
it 's not .
<unk> is a social <unk> business .
we use tourism as a tool for sustainable development .
more , we use <unk> as a tool for sustainable development .
so , <unk> and <unk> .
because the people who travel with us and travel to the <unk> privatization
they pay for your journey , like another person .
but they just travel differently .
they live with <unk> .
and the principle is not too much more stressed , or a lot of <unk> in exchange .
social engagement .
and <unk> .
and then , our participants are going to be regarded and interests in different projects .
we can do a comprehensive tourism tourism in the regions that otherwise ca n't have to have a chance of classical tourism .
because simple the infrastructure are lacking .
we can promote sustainable projects .
we can monitor your sustainable projects and pay attention .
so we 're offering us a hundred percent of themselves .
they 're not on fundraising .
and that 's what we 're doing is for our <unk> art .
let 's start with our work in nepal .
<unk> year , we have our engagement in uganda .
and then , over four years ago , i 've got married and my husband , and i have a team as a team .
do we go to the <unk> ?
or what else would be bigger ?
if we go to the <unk> ?
if we do n't just become social engagement , and sustainable , do n't just get a social engagement and a sustainable sector , but development in its wholeness ?
and also the individual <unk> ?
or <unk> individual <unk> .
it 's basically a <unk> business .
a company that looks at the company .
but in other words , the same philosophy like <unk> .
do we want that ?
was the next question .
<unk> new companies ?
we want that .
we love entrepreneurs and their creative companies .
because we are equally .
because we speak the same language .
because we dream the same expectation .
because we understand the challenges .
and that 's why we have <unk> a sister .
<unk> .
and with painstaking trepidation , we rely creative companies in their development and confidence that we support from extraordinary people .
we also talk about the participants , entrepreneur or employee , of creative companies with individual development .
so the personal social and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
and <unk> that were preparing to be <unk> .
there 's another thing in <unk> again .
a commitment to an meaningful system has another one .
it shows you a relatively short time to where you 're or where you 're <unk> .
wherever you may have more biases .
wherever you 're in too little flexible , you may think about this .
and it shows one thing that you 're doing right now .
it 's going to be his strength of eyes .
it 's the creativity that 's still great .
or , of course , it 's the demographic to find out .
the conventional things do n't want to change things .
and the force to change things that you can change .
and you can change it .
it 's in very short time .
we know that .
one example .
these are <unk> rock <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
that 's five very wonderful women from uganda .
with sad <unk> and talent .
she was <unk> beautiful , <unk> <unk> for years .
and for years , nothing happened .
because they just had no market for it .
because they do n't know how to improve the quality .
because nobody said that design might come in question .
we wanted to help these women .
and so in this year , a <unk> system .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
products out of poverty .
there 's a income .
a future .
we went yesterday with our <unk> live .
and we 're starting to begin with one of these spam <unk> .
a <unk> <unk> by a thousand <unk> of our women .
the sell with you just a year a income .
it enables us to make a lot larger .
so , this first drone is just the social dot and <unk> in one .
so who wants to support , can make this , to the purchase of the purchase , you can also travel to the other , and it 's perfectly able to travel directly into the project .
he can travel to the women and <unk> active .
in the long term , we do n't just give five women in a few of women , but at least or a hundred .
and that 's not just in uganda , but also in nepal and in other places that we 're working on .
so , this is this session 's just a project from our integrated cycle of projects .
we 're working in all of the ecological fields .
in the area , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
because the work in one is just a domain .
what happens to kids if the women ?
right .
so we 've started nepal in nepal , in a year , two acres of law .
everything brings up in our cycle .
and the whole thing still makes sense , when every single project .
we 're going to put it into the various projects .
and so the real way then they 're just going to do in the common work .
and i 'd like to leave you to the conclusion .
and then , i appeal to close your eyes .
you know , you 're looking at you in africa .
in the rural heart of uganda .
you 're sitting at a wooden seat .
and it 's satisfied and sick .
you just had to have lunch with your <unk> .
there was <unk> .
<unk> .
tasty .
the walls are <unk> .
here it is comfortable .
you <unk> out of the window .
and you see kids on the <unk> <unk> .
her mother feet <unk> the sand .
you <unk> your <unk> .
there 's a thin plate of <unk> .
children are laughing .
and call your name .
you 're <unk> you , they 're not just <unk> .
<unk> .
you do n't know what it is .
but you 're going to get up to bed .
and the <unk> , which is the children , <unk> .
at the end of the street , there 's a big tree .
you 're going to meet you with a word .
in the <unk> , in the <unk> , in the shadow , in the shadow of the stick , you 'll be sending the new design of their <unk> spirit .
you 'll get your hands and feet .
later , the other women will come to women .
they smile to be <unk> .
until you get your hat out to you .
the tree .
it 's a <unk> .
right there are internet here yet .
tomorrow <unk> you with your coach .
that 's what you 're talking about .
the exchange is every time .
it 's nice to be a nice thing to speak again .
you 're hearing music .
and the <unk> of <unk> .
mom <unk> in the <unk> .
she 's singing a african song .
you 're comfortable and happy .
you can make your eyes back .
each one of us can be used to be in something new ways .
or at least , for a short time , a little bit new .
and what happens .
thank you .
before i start to start , i would be interested in the evening that you 're here , there 's a <unk> house here .
i do n't see the light of this light , but maybe someone else .
here you see there .
two .
here , if you do n't , `` i do n't , but in any case , two , maybe two , that 's beautiful , we 're <unk> .
i also have a building , which is also a building , which is the break mountain of the city .
that 's the building .
together with 20 people , i have been occupied in the last summer six months .
and that 's why i 'm going to leave you here tonight .
well , you might like to tell some of you .
what should it be ?
<unk> there is a lot .
but i want to explain it to a moment .
oh what , what do you think , well , what ?
and then you put in the park or what ?
just a small choice of asking the questions that we know , friends , colleagues have learned when they had learned that i was part of a collaborative initiative that i 'm going to do is , something <unk> names .
everybody did that we had a lot of justice in the <unk> .
and here about these fountains <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and sent them .
and to make the privatization of this desire .
but who knows me , that 's not my kind of thing .
and it was n't the forgotten <unk> of the initiative .
what we see here is a sign from the top side of a <unk> passage in <unk> .
this is a public space , which is only private , and therefore for many people do n't have to do it , but not in public hand , and therefore not as they can use public spaces .
we were a group of <unk> structures where the desire with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , sensitive and sustainable .
and we wanted to tell a different <unk> .
we were a <unk> team , and we have to see this very quickly because it was a very uplifting team .
out of the broad architecture , civic social -- -- politics -- and <unk> <unk> , statistics , design , photography and <unk> .
of course , with different social and personal contribution .
our perspective <unk> and <unk> .
and we 're allowed to take us on different networks of different networks .
and creative has <unk> solutions in the <unk> that we 've done before .
we 've actually selected to occupy it .
however , it was something that we break the focus with stories and ideas .
we have started to memory and paintings .
and from these memories and photographs , we try to develop possible perspectives for the targets .
and it was really important that this process was always going to happen .
we 've been looking at ourselves as a <unk> and a <unk> reaction .
this was a <unk> and <unk> operated and became a <unk> .
so on the experiences we 've done , we 've started to go to the evening .
every city has adult places .
that one would be a face .
in many cases , this has been <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in the series of citizens as foreign places .
they 're the dead places of a city because they do n't often be in the state of what we expect in a public space .
so for example , we have <unk> , for example .
they 're going to have these , but also , in fact , public spaces , in fact , that 's often <unk> .
now , the initiatives that want to age these places like that , many times they want to be in the infancy .
what did it have to do with me , some questions here like some of you .
i mean , a lot .
these places in the city is not just a face .
no .
they 're the social places in our city , in which our social lives .
that 's how we often get to our facial neighbors when we meet ourselves from the way to target .
and if we can just have a whole time to sit on , and in fact , when the spaces are designed .
and we 're just <unk> <unk> .
and there 's diatoms with us , sometimes .
but what happens to security is a sense of community .
and the more i 'm going to do it in such a public space , the faster and the way , you know , that community .
and when i do n't <unk> myself , what you 're doing is what you 're doing is to call the efficacy of a global city .
we then , two challenges .
we can be aware of the citizens of consciousness , responsibilities and engagement for their neighborhoods or in the <unk> .
how can a nuclear sector be transformed ?
how can make criticism in ideas ?
categories against the privatization of the physical privatization and the <unk> of these <unk> zones of places and criticism versus the world and , in fact , they 're not interested in the same places .
so imagine you 're sitting here , you beat the newspaper , and i want to read the newspaper .
and love <unk> and citizens , we bring them three possible varieties for the ministry of the financial <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
you can choose to the idea of the idea of the idea .
and the main message with most of the educational revolution is going to do that <unk> .
would you go ?
would anybody go to this event ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounds great .
there 's an opportunity to do .
they 're allowed to think like this in the future .
and as i said , it sounds great in the first moment .
i 'm going to attempt to do it in a explanation .
and that 's because i think you 're not really going to really be able to do it , or you can choose or lifestyle , <unk> .
one is , as a result of a sudden , a lot of seconds <unk> .
that means , in fact , you 're not a method to make really own ideas or fundamental alternatives , but it 's already going to be design , and you can decide whether they 're immature or <unk> in urban water plants .
or , as a friend , which color color , which color color would be for example .
second explanation , traditional <unk> is not about information and peril .
think about three kinds of stuff .
so what we want to do is we want to show you , and they 're allowed to do it .
and frustration and my <unk> are often the implications of what i find somehow understandable .
i do n't want to want to make a decision about <unk> or <unk> , if i really would have thought of <unk> .
but it 's also different .
even though we have the dna of our dna , many conversations have been given us , we 've learned a lot of <unk> experience .
so we 've looked at experiences , and that 's what i want to share for others .
i want to focus on other initiatives , other projects , but also , or most importantly , the domestic services and the politics .
because those are the ones that are the ones that are supposed to be able to do these days systems , and that 's what they 're actually responsible for .
and if the really thing is that interest in a physics , as often a lot of crap , and you 're going to have to get the skills , and then you have to have the creation of new <unk> .
it 's not even though i 'm looking at all of you , but it 's all that you 're sitting here today .
and that 's why i 'm getting paid for very important .
i think it 's important that you all go , and i want to give you to give you to give you with our blueprint , the <unk> .
and i 'm looking at them because they are the ones who can play with a new <unk> .
so , we have to look forward to the citizens of consciousness , responsibility and dedication for their neighborhoods and lust and how to implement ?
the first willingness to vote on .
in <unk> houses , citizens go to <unk> and different interests .
what we see here is a limit we invited to .
what we see here are some <unk> and <unk> in the conversation with citizens .
the goal is that all of these conversations have to deal with this conversation , so that it 's not the <unk> interest or the <unk> abilities of the people who are .
the citizens in the space are experts , they 're experts to their neighborhood , they know what they 're missing with a place , where tradition is a place and also , what they do before .
the <unk> area , especially in the city , to be able to translate to the city , to the project .
in the case , in a particular case , there can be more <unk> , the themes that are forced on the project .
this is all available to a <unk> , where all of the information is available for all of the people , and that 's going to be a place .
by perhaps , can also be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to have a identification of space .
it 's a dialogue on battle means that the wishes of the residents are actually serious .
and then when someone says , i want to take a <unk> next to the <unk> .
and of course , that can be a complete <unk> , but the destination has to be , in the other way with all the time , what is the right answer , and perhaps in the <unk> , but maybe one another place .
as i said , this has to come out of dialogue .
second point is several <unk>
our <unk> is a <unk> .
one feels totally obvious when it 's faced with a great group and talk about .
somebody else does n't want to write good , but the text is not going to talk to a big group .
some of the other people might have been burnt .
or build his ideas in <unk> <unk> .
what i want to say is to be different modes to make different targets .
so , for example , the way we have the possibility to come out , and that 's what happens .
in the background , small exhibition in the background .
we have the possibility to give up .
we have the possibility to paint .
we 've had the possibility to write .
regardless of the age .
that was a <unk> girl .
we had the possibility to connect our ideas with faces ideas .
and also the possibility outside of <unk> <unk> , it should be given .
that can happen for example , which can happen in a video game .
the <unk> and transparent rates of results that are done with the dialogue under the ground .
we 've accompanied the whole process of the entire process on facebook , and at the same time , and at the same time , <unk> <unk> over a <unk> distributed .
our third point <unk> .
you may remember that i said that ikea is often too late .
in my <unk> event , there was three finished <unk> .
<unk> is the process , but only when it 's worked out , and you ca n't know what to do with the appropriate area .
if through the conversation , and that 's what i 'm going to do when i 'm going back to the point , you 're going to go to the point , you know , that 's going to happen for a place .
<unk> also , by the way , is <unk> itself .
and then , when it 's not at the outset that the bush-kerry event and so forth , it 's made out of the experience from the previous market .
what happens now when citizens threw their city and their city .
it 's already in a lot of projects .
i have an example of <unk> here , which is the <unk> , is probably in many here .
so in new york , a project launched , there 's a <unk> .
in <unk> grass , there are <unk> dollars in six weeks dollars , the funding are possible to do , or at least <unk> .
so the time in august does n't invent the politics in august , politics could n't be different than the idea of their own .
now , the <unk> in new york , i do n't say , because he has become one of the most important <unk> of the city was not an idea of politics or administration .
in the opposite , the <unk> for the <unk> , there 's been stuck .
in <unk> , so we 're back again in germany , the citizens are already born to the production of a <unk> again .
the city had never been <unk> .
and the four weeks <unk> , which we have <unk> , the rich are totally than <unk> .
today 's the <unk> of the city .
as the site of the site is wonderfully wonderful , and the city has the <unk> , the women who started there , and other <unk> .
in your own hand , their own homes on the street .
in rotterdam , a <unk> <unk> .
all right , all right , you want to say .
and then we 're just going to do that , and then we 're just going to do that .
but i think it 's false to let the city of responsibility .
why ?
one , because you have a look at it , you should have a look .
while , there are citizens initiatives to be more initiatives , or businesses in the rule of one of the world , in any form of conflict , the city has been responsible for projects that are also on the edge of attention .
and , of course , the city of the city takes the projects , other means to be available .
a <unk> initiative , can only be <unk> .
and the goal was that , by the way , a temporary initiative was a temporary initiative that was planned for her graduate school , about half a year and the responsibility to the city .
it 's been a <unk> <unk> in january .
it 's still getting negotiation .
that 's why we have the problem of the problem that we could n't use the responsibility .
but we now know that if the city will continue to be successful , if the negotiations are actually successful , that 's going to be a <unk> .
in fact , in whatever form , it 's still open .
and to end , i believe that many of the projects that are convinced of their importance on their meaning , complexities or even their cost of the city , you have to be able to be secure and want to produce a chance .
if they 're just in time with your citizens .
in one of the city and citizens .
in one of the city and all of them , all of you , are sitting here today .
if we demand our way to demand , and at the same time , the <unk> of the citizens do n't like to hear , but as an exit ,
that 's it .
yesterday , we were sitting in <unk> in the <unk> , and we came into the <unk> .
we 've talked about <unk> .
so this idea , even the second chance , when it comes out in this life , it 's just a second chance .
we found really exciting .
and we were quite very quickly understood that there 's two things we did n't want to experience .
one is adolescence .
the second thing was happening on the table to school in school ?
no way .
no way .
school , some of you might remember the <unk> material .
i mean , it 's the most problematic year , but the words are going to get me to me immediately .
my neck plug together , and i just want to go back to it .
and then i do n't know what it was in my exams , then i was always who was always going to me next .
no idea what it actually is .
you 're going to understand it , and my high school was really not beautiful , and after i had my last <unk> behind me , it was totally clear .
and what i 'm saying now when i put on the year , some of the most beautiful days i 've spent spent when i spent in schools .
with a great desire and it 's appropriate .
what did it come from ?
so how could this happen ?
and that just started with something that happened to what i could n't do .
i got kids .
so my wife got the children .
and that 's why it was very clear that it was the one who had to deal with these <unk> .
and when she said , it 's <unk> .
and i 'm going to leave you today .
yes , <unk> .
and then i opened up the door , and i was walking in this metal and i 'd blow up , i felt invincible in the cafeterias .
this was what it looked like when it looked at us .
and the same kind of thing as high as high as high as high , and i <unk> myself , but here 's really a really ugly .
and when i listened to the teacher , and you know , the kids do n't learn the school for the school , but for some life , i 'm sorry , oh my god , the sentence .
what is this , what do we really have come out of the school ?
so many of us have learned a really good learned .
so where did you actually need a lot in your life right now ?
and maybe some of the capital 's still known to the capital of yugoslavia .
what is even more mature ?
or <unk> , this ability in a very short amount of time , just a lot of knowledge , so that i can get it back to the <unk> again until i get bad for ?
good , i took it to the <unk> , but otherwise ?
and what is a point of a point of a point of if someone becomes a good doctor ?
if the unknown is , and if the good things have ?
no way .
so , no way to live in life , not for school , we learn .
if we look like this , about <unk> years , in the middle of the world 's century , there might have voted it .
this is the time in germany in germany , and it was totally introduced in germany .
and where the system that we have today has his root .
and if we imagine the time back then , it was actually that people had no access to the knowledge of your time .
and there was this four or six years that they were forced to go to school and to know where they were , and they were really the only way that they had to know with the knowledge and the facts and the information of your time .
today , it has more information in its pocket as the largest library of the time .
and over the second century , that was the era of the <unk> .
that means , there 's a lot of changes in the world , and there suddenly people need to have these new machines .
but in the same time , also people needed these machines and repair .
and we needed people to build these machines and the ones that we could blow them down .
you might recognize it .
the <unk> system that we have in germany now has his root in this time .
and it really has made it .
well , because it was probably going to be that , what i 've learned in school for the time , in the school , the one stood out there in his life .
let 's look at the future .
let 's take the second century where it is , and let 's look at the year .
the year <unk> was this year , the first one was just beginning to work before .
i was done with my graduate school and thought now , now , now you 're going to do it , the first company .
yes , after some of you are looking at the internet , you know , `` i 'm going to do this , '' i said , `` well , ''
and some of the companies have <unk> and getting bigger and bigger , and we 're going to get this nice slow , and some of the companies go back to us again .
you 're always seeing two times two times .
and we had a few years after a couple of years ago .
so , we had such a beautiful growth , and we had so exciting jobs on board like <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i do n't know if they have concrete idea of what these people do , but when i was in high school , we had no idea that there would be something like that .
even when i was <unk> , so what the internet did n't talk about .
and the children that we 're going to do today in the school now is what 's going on in 10 , six , 20 or 30 years ?
the only appropriate answer is we have no idea .
and what you know , what do need to be successful in these future jobs ?
and if you 're honest , you have no idea .
and because we can look like this in the future who might give me the <unk> for machine .
there 's been <unk> , i read .
well , you see , you have no idea .
so how do we get out of school as high for life ?
what are the things we need to do to make children ?
and maybe this is what we 're going to look at is what companies are looking for people today .
that 's the <unk> facility , right ?
the alumni of schools and universities are going to come into the company .
and if you look at what 's going to look at what 's going to look like , you know , there 's something like the expertise .
you want to do that , and then you 're going to look at <unk> <unk> <unk> at 10 years and 12 years ago .
so that 's going to be able to afford to school and too .
but what could be done in school , the things that are always going to be important , these are the so-called <unk> , and i believe that these <unk> will be the <unk> <unk> of the future .
and that can sum up in the principle of three circles .
this is to one , companies will have employees , which are flexible , so flexibility is one .
and then almost all of these companies think of <unk> thinking .
and then these companies want to get the companies who are <unk> .
so we think tanks and <unk> .
let 's start with flexibility .
that 's relatively quickly understood .
if we look at how economics is working today , how fast as it works , how quickly changes .
<unk> , yeah , all of the internet 's business will come up from the internet in tomorrow .
there i have to deal with this change .
that 's what i call employee workers , who are creative .
there i have to go out of silence , who are <unk> .
that 's pretty much the opposite of what happened in the factory at the <unk> end of employees on the assembly century .
again , the second topic , the <unk> thinking is quite clear .
there 's the responsibility .
it 's about people who take responsibility .
first of all , and your own lives .
but also for the big stuff .
whether this is the company , or as a society , we want to take responsibility for the big stuff .
and the third factor , the <unk> , which will be almost most of the things .
and if we remember the football , the beautiful adage in the internet .
in argentina , it has <unk> <unk> <unk> , and germany has a team .
it was n't <unk> <unk> who won the world .
so that could happen in common .
and as a result , this great poet of our time , steve jobs , yes , <unk> .
it did n't have invented the iphone , who did n't invent the <unk> , who did n't invented in it .
and the team of a team , which has made that possible , because it 's just as a team that could do that .
so , in school , those three things might convey to what we 're learning for .
but there 's still more accurate , and it 's almost more important .
and that 's what learning itself .
if the only thing we can say about the future of security , is that it 's not spiritual , but the ability to learn to learn to the challenge that we have to live in life , and that our children are succeeding in the future lives .
and this is what i 'm going to do is to do that , which is what they communicate .
but where was i ?
i was sitting in that <unk> and the one who know that this is not exactly what you need to pay for .
that 's what i said , `` well , i do n't think about everyone .
until that moment , where <unk> are elected , that 's all invisible invisible .
yes , i was sitting there , and what i should say , at the sake of one of my kids , these were still <unk> parts of the event .
less , it was as a parent , if if this subject around the subject to talk about the subject , and learn the whole <unk> house .
and even less fun , when the child becomes sick , because in the schools of stress .
and finally ended up with this <unk> or a peak of this <unk> <unk> at that high school .
in fact , it was n't a <unk> , and it was rather like a <unk> , right directly to the last hour and in reality , we were also the only parents who were invited .
and i 'm going to tell you now , and i 'm sure by looking at the details of the time when i was clear , we have to paint our child , and that 's not one .
but two years in which we 've studied , there 's something that works .
what are we wrong ?
and we actually had the question to be stuck with our child ?
and are we the only one that go ?
now , in the last two years , i 've been talking about this topic in the subject , i 've learned where i 've learned , i was n't alone .
there 's a lot of it out there , many of which it 's going on , and that was two years ago , and i was able to talk to a new business where the journey was going on , and at night , we sat on the bar and we sat on private things .
and what should i say , he almost told me almost the same story with one of his kids have almost the same story with one of his kids , and we had the same story we could get our children out from school , yes ?
in berlin , in berlin , in berlin , in berlin , there 's a range of different schools in berlin , and we could even consider <unk> .
but can you do that ?
in a way , somehow we had to bring our children in security and to leave that <unk> there .
and after we both have the idea of school , we were n't that we were in , we 're the first ones that we have to do .
in fact , how do we change as we have something different ?
the good news is that we 're going to carry ourselves .
we 're not alone .
but we 've been relatively fast on this whole range of amazing people , which did what we wanted to do , which is what we wanted to do is to create school that 's all the work .
it 's not that just the children , and their parents under the suffering , which happens there .
if we look at teachers , 30 percent of teachers have <unk> .
so if we look at how the number of <unk> period over the last 10 10 years has changed .
now , can you all parents make something wrong ?
that all the children are broken broken and that teachers are broken ?
or , of course , we have a school system that just does n't happen , like this <unk> <unk> years ago , that fits pretty much more .
and we 've found a lot of people who found it similar , and we even have people who have no children .
and they 've understood that they have to take responsibility for the future , by providing responsibility to what we need to do is to take responsibility for the future and the kids that are going to go to school with the road .
and we have a lot of <unk> schools , and there 's a whole bunch of great initiatives , the school , and there 's <unk> schools here , and there 's <unk> schools here , and there 's <unk> schools here , and there 's a really cool <unk> , and there 's a lot of high school , and there 's a lot of <unk> schools , who are really committed to the problem .
and there 's even one or other bold challenges , that 's going to go to the first step .
and how should we help as a tool ?
we did n't have an idea that we could now help .
but we can go one thing , we can go to these schools , and we can go to the people that are <unk> , so the parents , the teacher and the students , and we can move in two days .
so that 's where people come together in the past , and they 're going to learn how to work in two days , what it means to work .
they 're going to come up with a lot of concrete challenge that they 're doing in .
and after two times , the <unk> we have developed a new drug program , or the real script , we have had a new program of school as we 're able to talk about in a 22-mile school .
or these are some concrete things that they have in their schools .
within two days , some new ways that are instantly going to be implemented at the next day .
but what 's the scariest thing about this two days , and it 's going to be so nice to spend a few weekends that i have , and then to spend schools in time to spend in schools , this energy , which is coming to the three things .
if the three things in common , which is what aroused <unk> .
so , you know , they 're going to think of it as a team .
and then this is a piece of communication , the <unk> .
and if we 've been doing four weeks after this , we get to realize that the school has started to change that there was totally new culture .
and this is incredible .
and i 'm going to think of you thinking about school .
i <unk> 'em from school thinking about school .
and i <unk> , they also invite you , talking about school .
talk about what you like to talk about , but talk about what you do .
they 're going to be surprised as much as you get , and how many people have seen the same thing , but just not talk about it .
let 's bring us every single school in germany .
let 's change the whole system system .
and let 's make these things together , with the parents , the teachers and the students .
because we can do this .
thank you .
