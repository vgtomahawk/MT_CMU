yes , good afternoon , ladies gentlemen .
all right , so , for me , i 'm going to talk to you today .
and i have to imagine .
my name is <unk> <unk> , and i 'm happy known to find out of the city .
these are called <unk> years .
and my favorite language is , first , three organization , third , global public .
so i 'm for the <unk> of this city .
and you do n't care .
i know .
and this is something that my son 's particularly interesting , i 'm also <unk> .
that 's what i call the boss 's <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and half <unk> .
and what i 've been looking at me is , of course , is a theme of what i want to talk about today .
and so with the subject of the subject , because the story is .
we hope to the best , and let us tell the worst thing that we 've told us .
you know him .
he was <unk> at general .
and i 'm not going to tell you a little bit .
i 'll give you one .
so now , when we have a risk that we 're going to do is a disaster , for example , for example , for example , <unk> <unk> .
many people are left .
it 's turning it up .
and somewhere on the edge is a suitcase , a <unk> , a <unk> , maybe <unk> .
none of it seems to be .
the suitcase heard no .
so suddenly a <unk> .
take the <unk> .
teacher goes , <unk> , <unk> .
people say .
terrorists were <unk> .
go ahead .
what is there ?
we do n't know , or we ca n't say it .
people have the building .
children cried .
some of them may even be able to get anything to go .
suddenly , a little bit .
there 's <unk> .
it 's a panic .
i love now .
the rest is going to get their imagination .
but it 's not a sense i 'm wearing <unk> ?
this is what 's going on in this week .
there 's a video by two .
now , she noticed that only , in <unk> , nine pounds of goods .
but people were right , and so a friend i was looking at the building .
it did n't say .
and it 's exactly exactly the little time in the group that was my friend in my friend .
god 's gone to panic , otherwise if there 's no whole six hours , as it seems .
you can see in a <unk> , in a <unk> disaster , a lot of communication is a really important .
communication is also important because the people in this situation is inherently beneficial .
you want to know what 's going on .
it was in the good news , old time was the best thing to do .
we just did n't know or we have .
why ?
because this is called <unk> .
you 've got to tell you , god , people who were talking to us , because we do n't want to say the truth or we say the <unk> .
this is in a period of social media , in a while , for a few of facebook , in a period of health and public health , in a period of <unk> and public health .
now , and so , as well , as it 's not a bad deal of it , and it 's not a lot of scientists , and we 've got the last one that we 're talking about the event .
you remember , if you were looking at the <unk> in the hudson river , some of a year ago .
the first thing about this came on twitter .
and you know , who was on a tour of simple , and as soon as it snows , it 's a plane , and we save the people .
this was not a <unk> .
you see , we 're willing to look at today , and we 're trying to tell the idea of what the truth is to say ,
because most of us , however , we have the last thing that it does n't know the truth , because we have to be able to stop the same time as we can <unk> .
there are public media or poor media do n't seem very well or not .
so , in the way , we will work in food , and that 's also something that we 've been working on the media , we think we can focus on the future .
and we 're going to take a good old <unk> again .
but just as a form of <unk> .
so this is what we 're talking about in the next few years of building blocks in the <unk> , which is some of you all , and it 's going to be a <unk> .
it was once .
you know , you know , you know , there 's three times as long as long , and again .
i do n't know .
we 're going to do this with all the things that we have in this particular way , so now , <unk> <unk> , talking about twitter , talking about twitter , talking about twitter , talking about twitter , and the <unk> media and so forth , and of course , there are still with the information .
and what we know we have to do is very quickly , and we 're going to be able to do it very quickly and <unk> , because the train and citizens are supposed to be treated .
and we did n't have to think about what we want .
communication in the crisis , and in the disaster , is a question of how much of the media that we have , and it 's also a question of <unk> .
bandstand is our biggest problem , because the <unk> and the vehicles are either , or the <unk> , right ?
we 've also done good things with facebook , parents and twitter .
now , you may have some of them in the media .
we have a lot of <unk> radio in food .
and this is a <unk> facility .
these are mike , who are connected to a <unk> <unk> , because the people in the world 's <unk> , but in the world , in the second world war , and only in the other 21 countries , and only in the world , in the second world of the world war , and at the second , in the second world war in the world war , and only in the middle of the war in the second world war , and it has been <unk> .
the problem is only , many of these worms have never worked , and it 's like the way through the pile of food .
and there we were from a journal of the guy , the way that he was so much like this was called `` silent , '' was like , `` we 've now said , `` he 's got the warmth of it , it was a microscope .
by the way , there 's been a few centuries of the buddha in the wild .
we 're going to see what we can do .
these limbs have to be used to be processed <unk> , but they 'll be <unk> .
and so what we 've got to do is the <unk> park , and we 're going to have a lot of <unk> , and it 's like a waterfall .
and additionally , in the history of the city , the whole communication system of facebook and twitter , with the missing that the whole range of <unk> are <unk> .
and the media were excited . they were in the background .
we did n't even know with them , but we have <unk> and <unk> , all about <unk> and twitter .
and this has a big effect for us , because the average rate has been <unk> about these social media .
so , you know , you have to take me a sign when i 'm talking about .
i ca n't come from here .
this is the power of this , because first of these social media has to have the advantage that they are very different .
not so much <unk> , because the police who are <unk> out there , or the <unk> , as you buy it .
two , little meters .
if nothing is n't true , it does n't seem to be able to look at the <unk> , that i 'm talking about , you know , on the entire community that you have in the margins .
and it 's a very high <unk> idea , so if any ant is wrong , it can also be very fast .
and we have a huge <unk> .
and i said , <unk> , who would find that simple , like a bomb in the <unk> park .
so this is what we 've done in all the things that live in the last few years , and it 's much more accurate than the <unk> of a very first time .
and the city can be every day of such a catastrophe .
it 's going to be in a park that 's got to be in a park , is certainly not one of those .
but it can also be , and so , for example , we 're going to be able to put it in the <unk> , and then we go back to our <unk> , and we can use it in seven feet wide .
and if the people think about them , think of other cities , if you have to be <unk> , because you have to be able to do , you know , if you 've got to do , you know , you have a lot of houses , you know , we have a lot of houses , you know , we have a lot of houses that you can not be like before .
and it 's important to communicate , because it 's only in one in a world of communication system , communication , to try to cure for people to prevent that , people who are able to protect themselves that are people who are able to be able to protect themselves .
and the social media help us all , well , they 've all had to be on the communication system , and it 's not just a guideline <unk> , as we can do that in the <unk> , <unk> , and certainly still in the 1970s .
so in this case , today 's not just a task of the proton , not only a task of <unk> or the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the solar system , and communication into the catastrophe , and we need a disaster to take us .
and here 's what it looks like .
there 's about twitter and a lot of people like all of the people , as if you were interested in , because first of the people were able to create a lot of people , and you did n't know , where they were n't .
this suggests , there 's also a lot of people , also for the public debate in the <unk> , but the introduction of chechnya with the <unk> and the gulf has just shown that the social media is from a <unk> , from a communication system .
and i hope that i have a little bit of that , that this medium , which is really important for the beautiful things of life , also in the top of the sense of life , as a lot of life , and it 's also a lot of improvement , and that we 've got to have a lot of improvement in the future , and that i 'm going to have a lot of improvement in the future , the instrument in the future , and so on the way that we can do , and i think we can do so much for their attention if we can do it all the time .
thank you .
so , a beautiful good evening .
i 'm <unk> different .
i 'm a writer and <unk> , as you can see .
and i 'm now going to get a whole bunch of coffee .
what it is , i 'm going to be able to get there , i 'm going to show you .
before i do n't , i have a few things .
the first one is , i believe that we really love stories .
we ca n't live for stories .
and also , i think there 's a lot more , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very much more time , of course , of course by definition .
and i also remember that the internet , the <unk> , in fact , like , i do n't want to be <unk> .
and fourth , i 'm fascinated with the people who have been used to be creative .
and they are happier , as they can be creative .
the more people are happy , people are better .
all right .
now , this better world is now just a <unk> .
in fact , i 'm just like , i read .
and the story that i want to tell you , i 'm going to go back in a bookstore where i 'm going to be <unk> <unk> .
this is <unk> .
and it 's <unk> <unk> .
now , you get rid of the liger , and it does n't seem like a lot of it , because in the moment , that it 's gone , something like it .
it happens in your head , in your body , with your perception .
and she did n't really love .
they do n't know what happens .
i have words for this .
i call this the <unk> of <unk> .
and you see on a side and <unk> in <unk> and everything is quite black .
i 've got to feel like i 'm doing a lot .
<unk> acid .
and on the other hand , we have the two <unk> in the background .
and it 's for me to realize that i want to be better <unk> and i 'm talking about .
so , the first thing is , which is what 's talking about your new perception is a lot of a <unk> man with <unk> <unk> , who 's very <unk> , and says , well , your life is over .
this is <unk> .
and <unk> de <unk> about what you heard about a very complicated way .
she was born .
scientists are people who are willing to come to their lives .
who 's talking about her ?
very nice .
imagine if you 're looking at the <unk> , you know , if you take them , but <unk> out of the pocket .
so , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , things .
what 's important is that the players have no exceptions to your <unk> .
we do n't know when we die .
i love you have a long life , but you do n't know .
it can be tomorrow .
and so , it 's also like me .
they do n't know how much they can do .
that means , every single minute could be the last one .
a player that has its entire lifetime of journalism , <unk> in the moment of the play , like a violin , the <unk> .
now , you know , if you know , if this is so dangerous , why are all right ?
and the answer is very clear .
without play , without any day , a lot of time , <unk> , everything , just <unk> and only when a player plays , it 's actually alive .
they were born .
this .
this story of <unk> and how they are now the world of the player , all of the first challenges , and in fact , in the work , of course , in the context , is the story that i want to tell you .
and it 's in the form of a <unk> .
now , the first wall has 12 dinosaurs , sorry , i 'm here , i 'm a <unk> program that i 've seen before .
so , in fact , 12 components in the first flight with a maximum amount of seven to seven minutes .
this kind of <unk> , a result of the other hand , beautiful <unk> , who knows .
the west does n't know for his <unk> .
this is not new .
and if it would be , then i would first be first .
and yet , not yet .
now it 's just right now .
let 's go back to <unk> .
what is the most glamorous sentence from the movie or from the library ?
there can only be one .
thank you .
as we would have done that .
and that 's why it does n't trust me .
you can do it very much .
there are so many different games .
think about rewards , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
and that 's exactly the number of gamers .
and so there 's a lot of stories that everybody wants to talk about .
now , the next question is , who cares ?
i have a pretty big deal of me .
i think for a smart and more creative .
but i know that hundreds of brains are more likely than just one another , even if i have my slide .
and so this is what it was in the idea that you had the computers with the creative process .
what if we do n't just use <unk> or hurdle , but even <unk> ?
so , if you say , we have a look at it , you know , is that the development of this point of view .
imagine that , for example , there 's a <unk> breaker that they 've heard of early england , because he says , for example .
they also have a big fan of copepod .
now , you can just think about technology , that 's not very difficult to have a <unk> .
and this place you get into the <unk> , where it 's going on , and this is the really cool thing that 's really really interested in .
it 's not somewhere underneath it , but it 's going to be right at it .
the really beautiful is that we are in the internet .
and in the internet , you can do everything .
so , every medium is somehow .
that means you can read the audience , you can buy , you can do whatever .
and if we 're also looking at this structure .
this looks like a little bit more <unk> , right ?
and so this is what 's going to be used for what 's going on .
and i 'm really amazed by the fact that the internet was born to tell exactly what i had to talk about .
it just does n't seem to be so many , but nobody .
so , i 'm also going to be a step , and i always get to the audience themselves .
it 's in a <unk> .
so you can go to the <unk> from the series , but the people in the real environment , which is that these <unk> on their cellphone .
<unk> that , you know , they 're all very good , you have a lot of mobile and <unk> <unk> .
and this is a <unk> coral , which is starting to create .
and i 'm not able to stand up because i want to stand up for a few minutes .
we 're doing it .
each one is a bunch of three parts .
the first part is the <unk> , the second part of the <unk> , and then we have the <unk> .
and so , with this <unk> , i was able to have the luxury of the way , i 've got to understand the question : the <unk> innovation .
i 've had the first price for best .
and i have to say , this bandstand is from the <unk> , from the <unk> , <unk> and so on .
so , young people , you should be .
and if i can convince that , with this , the internet is really going to use the laws , the virtual language , to the world , i think i can really tell anyone .
this .
everyone 's like , well , why does this work ?
because it 's all used in this name every day .
now , of course , we first have the <unk> . who 's what i 'm going to do , you are , you 're all , you know , everyone is .
of course , people die .
in the series , there 's been much more .
every one is , everyone needs to die .
and then also , every one is to be in the sense of everybody , when he wants to .
that 's me completely .
i 'm going to talk about the <unk> , and there is nothing worse from my opinion as if it 's like a <unk> .
i do n't know if you know .
now , if you 're in the theater , and the actor in the audience , and you say , `` oh , oh , please ask .
and it 's not .
so it 's <unk> interactions .
and no one .
he can also be the audience .
and the reason i 'm talking about is the fact that the whole project is also going to be in the first time .
that 's a couple of reasons .
i 'm going to start with this project long time , and i was asked myself , but this is all the english , all sorts of questions , blah blah .
and i can just say , `` the german <unk> of the world is the third largest world .
the <unk> is the english , and the sky and then the german .
so it 's not like we 're going to face in any small terrain .
and really , i think really really , if there was also other people like me , that people would be grateful for something that would be grateful for any <unk> <unk> , where in the end .
so if all of this would be like , as i would like to be , then the first result came up on the first stage .
and if you ask me why i 'm now , i 'm going to talk about a bicycle <unk> , which is where it 's made out of the secret <unk> .
i 've done a couple of thoughts .
i love back-of-envelope .
not just <unk> .
i 'm also known to <unk> and <unk> .
a couple of <unk> were also <unk> and <unk> .
and i 'm just saying that this whole thing is incredibly important , and it 's incredible .
but it does n't make all that if you do n't like that .
and my project is just <unk> , where i just learned to me .
and it 's got .
and it 's pretty good .
i can just tell you .
so , if you think about somebody else , i want to do this part of me , i 've got a lot of character , or i 'm not going to do with a <unk> <unk> or whatever .
you see in the internet .
on facebook .
amazing , like , the ted talk .
yes , <unk> .
can i read memory : can you stand memories ?
man ask them .
can you fly memory ?
can you understand everything in your life ?
do you remember koko ?
who has someone who can remember ?
they do n't get any hands .
so , can you prioritize memory ?
it 's true .
thank you very much .
no , we just wo n't do today .
and then i want to talk about this talk .
all right , my name is samuel <unk> .
and i 'm going to read about this , because it 's two of my passions or my two big passions .
i 've done here in los angeles , and i 've been reading with the size of diana , which is so many through the world .
and <unk> my time , i 've also been able to take a permit and <unk> in the private and a <unk> .
so in the one hand , i have a lot of work with the computer , i 've been working on the computer , i think , in the way that work is the human condition ?
how can you change that ?
that 's about a comparison of these <unk> .
i was in a very interesting discussion about artificial intelligence , <unk> <unk> .
so , the question was , when we could ask , when we could build a computer program that would be like the human brain ?
so , and i 'm right here .
so , i 'm going to have a couple of old , three hundred years , more , more , more , more , more , more , more , more , more than two .
but let me look at why , as you need to say that , as you need to take it .
so the <unk> on the computer on the computer , and our brain on the other side .
now , if we take the computer , it 's all of us , so you take a smartphone , your <unk> , and also , all these cameras , and all of us are all avid uranium .
he 's called <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and these parts are placed from a rubber trend .
so the word has heard of all of us , and in fact , it will always be as a triangle .
the <unk> little device , which is three dials , and it 's <unk> through .
in our computers in our teenage years , we 've got to look at <unk> <unk> about five hundred million of these little parts .
and they 're going to do the observations .
we have things that we can learn things that we 've heard about that we can hear about the fact that we can hear about the age of einstein , and so we can hear that computer can be very , very quickly , but very quickly , but it 's only able to do any other , and very quickly .
it does n't work anymore .
he 's actually quite modest .
let 's want it to our brain .
our brain has been perceived as much of the neuron , the secret , and we have , and we have <unk> , 1,000 billion neurons are in our gray mass .
but the beauty is , our organs are not only three connections , and they 've gone to <unk> plants .
and this is a <unk> <unk> , just because it 's nice , 10 billion .
these are 10 to 14 seconds .
so , you can see the complexity of our brain , as long as we have in computers .
so , if we want to take the <unk> times , the other hand , the other one , the first one wore their own power , called the <unk> , and with the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> was <unk> .
we have a <unk> <unk> , but the box here is about 20 watts per gallon .
and the one , and this is the size of two large bananas , so you do n't need and you want to look at you guys .
now , if we do a lot of good about there , <unk> <unk> good computers , why do we forget things ?
now , you know , or a few of these other insights in the internet , like , `` human condition will only be 10 percent of his brain , you 're going to get this <unk> to the <unk> future .
and <unk> there is a little bit .
ten percent , yes , but our brain is , in this case of our evolution , we have a little bit of <unk> , so in the middle world , there 's a little bit more , so in the middle , there is our little bit more <unk> .
this is not happening , because we do n't use it .
why does it mean that we do the biggest part of it ?
maybe you know the term of the <unk> ?
now , i 'm going to take a look at this , if you look at the dracorex , in the sea , then the light comes down the road , it 's going to be a <unk> .
and these 10 percent of these are these are what 's our brains , our <unk> mind is our <unk> , is actually a total <unk> , <unk> .
we <unk> the term as we 're <unk> <unk> , of course , <unk> <unk> .
and , for example , the <unk> on this memory , perhaps , or a lot of other people with <unk> memory .
people who were working on the same time than i did n't see in the situation , and i tell you to say , `` how do you know ?
this is there , there 's a special , a <unk> , so someone who 's got a part of a field , which is the very high school , and it 's a <unk> sign in a plane , and it 's a <unk> sign in the plane , and it 's a <unk> sign in the plane , and it 's a <unk> sign in a plane , and it 's begun to read the abc city .
and it 's not like this river , and there is this , which is , no , every single house , every single screen , every single screen , every single windows , every single windows , every single windows , he did n't even get it .
so where is this ?
so why can we say , why ca n't we say , well , that 's because it 's all about it , it 's more likely to be <unk> <unk> for its <unk> percent .
now , we 're also saying , but why ca n't we look at the back of the night sky , right ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> from me made interesting things .
and so he was working on a living room , and he was working with a <unk> meeting that he did n't understand the experience , which was not happening , so that 's gone .
wonderful , so it 's very good .
now , it was about to make people <unk> .
this is what she was able to remember in a very game , the way , or after that event , even if they were n't going to remember that , you could find the platform of the car , where these people are <unk> , who 's not <unk> , and that 's called eight meters .
and in fact , with this case of one of the villagers .
the second thing i 've had been a great thought was , was he was an actor in the <unk> who was told that the mother had always been on his own 20s when she was a little kid .
and she went to read her mom and her mother .
and then he said , in malawi , you can imagine .
and then finally , she started four , and she was four than this is , you can not read , but you can not read this .
and then you have said , `` i 've got the <unk> .
in fact , you have a copy of alice at the bottom of the sidewalk , where exactly the page of the text stood out .
so the brain has shown this page as it was <unk> .
and she could read it .
so yes , we have actually access to it , but we seem to live in the normal life we have to do , in fact , we have n't <unk> .
now , we 're not going to look at the event , but as <unk> said , he 's got a picture , a <unk> , we 're going to see what we 're doing , what if you look at what we 're doing , what if you say , what we feel like , what if you say , what we 're doing , what it feels like , `` well , what we 're doing is what we 're doing , what it feels like , `` well , what we 're doing , what it feels like , `` well , what we 're doing , what it feels like , `` well , what we 're doing , what it feels like , `` well , what we 're doing , what it feels like , `` well , what we 're saying , what it feels like , what it feels like , what it feels like , what it feels like , `` oh , what we 're doing , what it feels like , `` well , what we 're doing , what it feels like .
and , of course , there 's been a long long time ago , and she did n't get <unk> , and so i 'm going to ask you , i just wanted to know her eyes .
and remember , you know , in a very happy , positive event in the human past .
take the first thing .
and if you do that , you might think that you have a visual issue .
you have a picture , maybe a movie ?
now , it does n't seem to do this because we do n't necessarily like that .
and if you can see that , it can be either in the movie of your eyes , or whatever you can see .
this is a call called the <unk> of this .
thank you very much , you can do the thought back to the moment .
who has a visual information , right ?
yes , there 's a few hands up , so this is like a lot of hands , that 's about what i 'm going to say , it 's about what we expect , it 's actually something that we were doing , but it 's actually something that we do n't know .
well , let 's go back .
so , what 's beautiful is , if you were <unk> memory , if you 're <unk> memory , you ca n't just look at the memory , you know , and it 's beautiful , there 's beautiful , and it 's beautiful , there 's nice , because it was beautiful , because it was beautiful , because it was beautiful , because it was beautiful , because it was beautiful , because it was beautiful , because it was beautiful , because it was beautiful , because it was beautiful , because it was beautiful , because it was beautiful , because it was beautiful , because it was beautiful , because it was beautiful , because it was beautiful , because it was beautiful , because it was beautiful , because it was beautiful , because it was beautiful , because it was beautiful , because it was beautiful .
and now what 's happening .
<unk> everything was , well , the brain makes a difference between what we actually did , and what we wanted to do .
and so , you can imagine if you 've got home to the back of the back of the back of your mind , and you can imagine something in the future that it 's not possible , if you remember what 's going on .
and , you know , these stories that you 're talking about in <unk> , from the time .
at the time , hey , there 's what 's happening , and that was so beautiful , and the lot of these stories , the beautiful often , the great things , the great laughs , they were still a lot of romantic , there was a lot of embarrassment , there was a lot higher .
now , if we do that in the fire , if we do our memories , how do we do this ? what we do ?
<unk> , when i came up to me , my uncle has a picture , from his hut in switzerland .
a very beautiful picture , it 's also a very beautiful sight .
now , the picture is `` little billy talks about beautiful , and it 's a great dog , i 'm sorry for him , because this is a beautiful dog , it 's a beautiful dog , because it 's a beautiful dog , and it 's a beautiful dog , and it 's a beautiful dog , and it 's a beautiful dog , and it 's a beautiful dog , and it 's a beautiful dog , and it 's a beautiful dog , and it 's a beautiful dog , and it 's a beautiful dog , and it 's a beautiful dog , and it 's a beautiful dog , and it 's a beautiful dog .
and why do n't we do this because of our own thoughts , our own memories , faith , what do you do that , when i think about that ?
in fact , they have a lot of freedom to their own thoughts .
you know , you know , you know so many people who you see them in the face you see when you 're just immersed in mozambique .
i did n't feel guilty to me the whole lot of <unk> .
all the night and this thought i did .
i think it 's the way he does n't think the thoughts .
the son <unk> friend <unk> me when he went to germany , and his mother in ottawa , and he did n't quite wait .
what the father has been done , so he 's got to come up with his son , and he said , well , what was the most beautiful thing ?
what was the most fun thing , tell up , and then he made him to tell him , he made him to tell him what i was doing .
and , in two weeks , i was <unk> .
and then it 's ok , the fbi is gone , that 's coming back .
and this is the whole youth talking about this , which is one of the smartest people i know .
so it 's not the memories that affect us , where we are , but it 's our focus on what we want to do .
and how much energy we use it .
so if you were <unk> <unk> , you know , `` well , that 's now said , `` well , that 's now said , `` you know , do n't have a look at the <unk> , '' they said , `` you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
what is we talking about <unk> , right now , whoa , yeah , what 's funny , right ?
and then you take it .
take this with her <unk> and let it go .
or if she 's <unk> <unk> <unk> , she 's <unk> her your boss , or her husband , or your husband , <unk> , you know .
so , look at the picture , put them a funny event , sir .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> , let 's jump on the back of the mouth , but they laugh , why do they laugh ?
because you can imagine , because these guys are funny .
and you can get much better with the situation .
so is a man <unk> ?
no , i think our brain has a lot of capacity to make it all .
but it does n't matter , because we can choose free , as far as we focus on the way , and how important we have a event , a memory , it 's on us .
my view of you , you 're going to play with the images in your head , you 'll take the power of your cubicle , and you give him every day that they give their lives .
i love .
thank you very much .
now , if i 'm going to read on a party , what i 'm going to do with you with me , you know , i 'm going to ask you with a <unk> <unk> , and you can see ira eyes , and in the heads of my audience , the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
now , when i 'm talking about it , it 's a <unk> for classical music , if you look at the quality of old people who are sitting in love , and i 'm talking about it .
adam <unk> said to talk about music to speak about architecture .
and so , for example , that 's what we do .
and so you have a picture of what i 'm talking about , i 'm going to show you a short film .
morton bast
it 's very <unk> <unk> .
this brings it from my view of the best .
so , for example , the <unk> of the movies , it seems to do something very different .
we are now between today , and in fact , a hundred years old , and we have a lot of uganda in our youth , which is incredible force and joy .
but what we 've been able to do is that the inventors of the <unk> and the <unk> of us have a joy , well , a little <unk> .
and we are the <unk> , which is the so-called <unk> of the <unk> music is not the content to the content , and it 's based on its <unk> .
so , we can ask the question , how can we create a <unk> that the music and the power , and so that we can do so .
how do we create a <unk> , which is the basics of the <unk> ?
we ask the parameter that you 're looking at the classic side , space , time , lights , context .
so let 's take a relationship between our family and clinics .
and usually you have between the stage and the tail .
we 're trying to keep the misdirection .
this is a picture of our <unk> .
the musicians interact with the audience , send out , in the middle of the audience , are going to play , play , you go back into the audience .
the whole thing is going on at the bottom of the night .
everyone who is telling us , and it goes on the stage , and it goes .
or that 's in the concert .
in the classic concert , it 's like you 're looking at more or less , very quickly like you .
there is music , because you do n't even get married .
and we 've done the way we can do this .
if you can play differently , and you can get a little bit of music , you can hear all different .
so it turns out that we did n't have a stage , because it 's four samples around the audience .
the audience could <unk> .
this is what i 've been looking for in the first row .
it 's important for us that we do n't just make any more freezers , but that we think of music .
so , what do we ask for africa , and in addition to the people of the people who believe that they can do ?
and so , at the same time , at the age of <unk> at stanford p.m. , <unk> <unk> , which are actually used by <unk> , shipped in <unk> , in old <unk> .
but not just the spaces that are going to be music , and the lighting can be music , and yet , but the connection with others .
and so we 're completely happy that we 've been working for a couple of years that we 've been working on with our head or <unk> to music , but it 's not to dance .
and so , there are <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
and in this year , we have a <unk> , but if you want to add <unk> .
so we 've got to have a concert in front of these <unk> .
we 've heard the story from the soldiers of the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> them .
this has been done so much because we had a big <unk> program that we 've done in this piece .
we have done a lot of money that we 've been working on to people in the united states , so we could use that .
in fact , this script is something that is out of a community .
we 're completely happy in los angeles to have a home .
the city is that the size of this is the size of a biological , and we 're also able to look at the same time , but as small as we find it .
if the last two weeks ago , in a year , two weeks ago , in the town , they just began to see that in the city , people are more likely to be treated as well .
it 's all the <unk> force .
we inject them are a <unk> mixture of students and students , our <unk> , our <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , really mysterious .
and for a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> or a <unk> , or the <unk> , the <unk> to 10 <unk> in a <unk> , that for a year for a year .
now , even though , ahmedabad , but they want to be about a year , which is about the <unk> or the <unk> , and the <unk> of the day , and it 's <unk> .
we do all of them in our homes and live in germany .
this is , the largest part of the work is <unk> and on a <unk> .
only three times in the year , we 're talking about this year , <unk> , which is , or the other ones that come up , and the other thing that we 're familiar with is that it would be incredibly important if you want to do it .
for example , 20 to 30 pounds of water campuses , which is used for a few days or a few weeks ago , and you can buy the play , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and of course in these 14 days , the crows have been doing it .
now , you could be able to do anything that you have to do for this .
but our <unk> is going on .
so we 've been in the city in the city in the city of the city in the city , and what we want to do .
this is from the classic <unk> , which is also about how much the things like this , we 've got a sense that brings us with bread , or the <unk> that connects us to eat .
it 's going to be built in a pile of town in the town over time .
until go to the <unk> .
we have found a whole bunch of studies that we have found out in the living of our living room with this .
and on this way , the way to get a little bit in this town and about the people in this city .
they identify in a very simple way of doing this .
so at the beginning of the year , we were able to take care of the citizens of the citizens of the gods that we have a million rudder in the <unk> , and we have a <unk> <unk> .
we 're talking about the cern mind that classical music has come up , and they 're in the right hands .
and so we are incredibly happy about this , in fact , a young musician , music , and home , in the streets of your life .
now , if you 're not looking at it right now , like the best , the music that you can actually do .
so the next year , we went back in <unk> , and we 'd like to go when you were .
yes , ladies and gentlemen .
you can think about it .
it 's hard to learn , or about the effect of learning , but i mean to learn a lot more , which is <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
you know , in fact , all of the experience , a nice formula for the <unk> .
and what i 've done today is art and culture , now , i can tell you a lot of you , because i still have a lot of , of course , i 'm in the field .
and so i figured out that it might be right to be a little bit of a magician , i think , in my talk .
art is beautiful , but a lot of work .
now , you have a look .
you can always see the laughter , even though most people know .
why is that ?
i think that , in the word , is a little bit of what we ca n't do right .
art , we say , `` this is what it means .
in the work , we 're going to work in that .
sometimes a second .
the people who work for me work for me .
but in work , we think about the <unk> and in the art of the work in the context of our lives , our experiences , our own thoughts .
and so , i have my favorite pictures that i want to share with you -- about three hours in five circles , who are all the secret , and i 'll just have it for you .
it starts with the <unk> , for the sake of time , i 'm going to talk to my youth , i 'm not going to tell you from my youth , i 'm not going to tell all of my youth ; i 'm not going to tell you from my youth , i worry about , i want to worry about my youth .
the interaction for the first part of my professional life , and finally , american , great .
and one of them will be able to get these pieces of <unk> .
<unk> , two and <unk> .
you learn them in the first two , three years , if you take an interactive , and i have a few .
and so , in the age of 11 , 11 , i have these little pieces , on the morning , not in the back to the home .
these experiences live from a <unk> .
there 's a slight face and the other voice deteriorated , but it 's all different .
the rhythm is the same , but it 's <unk> .
and this , ladies and gentlemen , is a matter of the art that it might be , and when it 's only two voices , they 're trying to think of what is the present , the future , the future , the world , for the moment , that the power are made , but it is the power for the moment .
and i 've learned to have two <unk> , sometimes , three , in the <unk> <unk> , simultaneously , to be able to listen to each other .
that was what i 've learned for you .
another experience that i 've never forgotten , and i 've been told that i would like that .
i have been <unk> , and it was more people in the room today , and in the middle of the <unk> .
i was afraid .
i witnessed her farm .
so back to the beginning , i did n't know .
so the audience has more <unk> than i did , because i went to my place , i met my grades , put it up , and began the third time .
and you do n't believe how to me .
but that was a very strong experience .
now , this is also one of my experience , where i knew , well , with eduardo , even though , i would n't be able to take my <unk> , because at least , you could try to keep my <unk> .
yes , the next chapter of mine , i told myself with inspiration , and as i want to tell you stories .
so when i was so <unk> , i went to my <unk> , and she was trying to play a <unk> .
and he said , jesus , that 's not .
there 's a lot of <unk> , and very much experience of women .
now imagine a <unk> young man , so , young , a sentence .
i did n't forget .
and of course , of course , i have more happy .
and so i was looking at the end of the time , in a <unk> .
i 've done and i remember having a situation that i 've never done .
it was the <unk> of <unk> , and now i went to the part of the time , i did n't just take the arms , and so far , and it took me and again .
i can not be able to play it , i 'm not a piano there , and i could n't do it .
i 've had this room for 30 years ago , and suddenly you saw .
and then i got it back and <unk> , and i 've got to go into a forager , and i just knew that i was looking at the ground .
i was n't myself .
i did n't know anything to do nothing , and the music had done with me .
one experience where i learned to love emotions .
and sometimes it 's also true to work for me to work in these organizations , in this state , i think it 's a <unk> .
where everything happens .
we 've also had this situation in the <unk> of a organization .
and so , again , almost like all of us as we did the <unk> , that only only two months ago , where they were going to be a few years .
now , these were my work with the five senses , with a lot of work .
and now i go to my company .
i was first time as a train train , but it was like .
we have <unk> knee , <unk> , <unk> .
i 've been <unk> , and i 've been so excited about my ankle for the music , and i had the <unk> .
in the ipod , you breathe , a <unk> encyclopedia , a lot of experiences that i have very , very helpful .
and then a point where i was as a <unk> in the <unk> theater , in the <unk> and the leaders , and i 've been able to do that in my <unk> , and that 's what i was thinking about , and that 's the case of the idea that i was working on , and that 's the case , in this combination of art , i was able to do that in the <unk> rainforest , poverty and law .
and the art of culture culture is to make my <unk> .
so here 's work for art art , but not as a artist , but they do n't want to say , but as a feminine <unk> and trying to do something .
i was in the theater , and i 've got to make a grant for <unk> , just in scottsdale , there 's no way for me to use art to create art to create a good leader , a good leader ?
and this was the reason i did , in my own business , and with <unk> years , i was <unk> .
but at the time , i had a lot of <unk> , and this ceremony , i was <unk> with interaction .
for example , i was <unk> to the germans .
the german <unk> , his <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm <unk> , although even in my ear , because i was born , i was born , i think i was born in the <unk> , always , i 'm going to be able to get it up .
but i have a <unk> camera , because my grandparents were also <unk> <unk> , and there , in malawi , i have the <unk> .
now , what i was interested in was something that i did n't know what i did n't know about , and suddenly , i was welcomed in a different form of culture , in a <unk> , in a culture , in a culture , in a culture , in a culture , in a culture , in a culture , in a culture , in a culture , in the middle of the <unk> ,
when the <unk> on us were all together in a very different situation , there 's another set .
and i used to be <unk> , and i think of the friend <unk> and <unk> <unk> , who was my friend and colleague , so i 've always been able to take a little tent , for example , i could <unk> his back .
we 've done the <unk> <unk> , so , but of course , we have a <unk> <unk> of autism , diabetes .
and this <unk> , of course , that came out of people .
it was my fate that i was at the age of london , and i did n't care about the wall .
i was looking at the nearest day , i have a characterization , oh , the wall is good , yes .
so for me , you 've been asking for me to ask questions about this question .
and then i was <unk> for the cities in vietnam .
and what i 've been working on , how social interactions can be between the united states .
in fact , we talk about the same language that the music is going to be beautiful , and it 's been a little bit , it was a lot of <unk> , <unk> .
unlike the altar , i did n't care about the people themselves all , and it was a lot of the world , and i 've been so much as much as much as much as a german hurdles , and i 've been looking for myself as much as well as the german <unk> , and i 've been trying to go back to slowly , slowly , and then the german <unk> , and those were the two <unk> of these two states .
in fact , germany is <unk> .
in fact , in spite of time , it 's much more <unk> .
now , i 've been working on all of these things , and i 've learned it in the city .
so we were talking about that , for example , i had a <unk> , and see that , when i started there , i was in the <unk> <unk> for culture and vice versa .
i 've got that .
she was listening to <unk> , you did n't want to write <unk> for culture and <unk> .
i was the first <unk> of the <unk> .
so i did n't have to work so much , but it 's wonderful that i did , but they 've been working on because i was working for education .
we 've done a lot of the cultural industry , we 've been able to take the <unk> between poachers , <unk> and <unk> , what we can do , the <unk> , where you can measure the relationship between the nature of the brain .
many , many interactions , we were able to design , and we were able to do , and we realized what that means , as many people out of different models together .
and what you realize is , i always spend more <unk> from art art , and more importantly , the culture of education , between cultures , between communities , between women , better in the way , and i come back to the art .
so computers could also be between the <unk> of the subject , as we were <unk> , seven or the idea of the <unk> , the <unk> , could <unk> the <unk> of europe .
but this last chapter , this fifth chapter , is the secret .
this is a word , i have two characters , which i can do with something , so i can use it , and i can use it as a verb , and i can use it as a verb .
and it 's always in his sneakers .
i know something about his <unk> , so i 'm going to say you or your family or the community .
and i 'm trying to do with something if i say to me , and i want to tell you that i want to show me .
and that 's a pretty big deal .
five years of three million people are trying to move around , <unk> cities , <unk> , <unk> , in order to be <unk> , and in order to create a community in europe .
so , as much , we 've got to <unk> it , but first as a community of many people who live in a big <unk> life , but at least a common language , even though , nations are there , and this is our <unk> , the <unk> of the people , and we 've got a lot of them .
in the <unk> , the <unk> of the highway , in other words .
a lot of the <unk> did n't have a lot of people .
there 's called <unk> <unk> and food , two schools , young , young girl from <unk> , from the <unk> , and young young members from a <unk> school , from <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> of people , young <unk> , from the <unk> tribe .
and it was an amazing effect that young girl talks from young <unk> and young members of the men of a young age of germany .
and there 's one of these young men on the top of a friend , and i found these <unk> that i loved .
and , of course , he comes from a letter , and he said , `` i 'm <unk> , he wrote him to home , as a young heart attack , '' because he 's got to be a <unk> , because my one of my two eyes are <unk> .
and he <unk> his finger with a <unk> , put himself on the back in the play on the <unk> of a <unk> , and try to play the <unk> .
and it did n't stop him .
it was so important to me , and i was looking at me , and what did we learn ?
we have learned that in fact , a lot of people can be able to get together , but before all of us , we have learned that we can not understand ourselves in the lives , because we do n't have a lot of ourselves that we can not deal with ourselves .
and that was a wonderful experience , and you can see it 's not just to know something .
it 's all about learning to learn something that 's about .
and if we have a lot of choice and invention , <unk> , when we tolerate it to us , we have a lot of art and culture , our own position , when we interact with the arts and culture , our own position to work with the art and culture , we 've all done .
and i hope you have a lot of <unk> and <unk> that you can get these <unk> .
thank you very much .
yeah , thank you very much .
i think we wait for the first picture .
so i 've been trying to use for my work of my own slides .
but it 's not a science experiment , but it 's going to be my science experiment , and i 'm going to find out what i think , that 's what 's going on in the next few years .
so in the <unk> , we know , thank you very much about what ted means , and i think we can do this talk .
and then i really knew that you should love the talk in english , if you can look at me , but if you look at it , you can see what i want to say , and i do n't know what i should say , and i do n't know what i should say , and i did n't talk about it .
how we die .
i have to tell you about <unk> .
<unk> was the patient in the hospital , and i was <unk> .
she was talking about <unk> years , and it was like to be in the other hand , because they 'd like this to her husband , the first man , in the war .
and so , you know , she had a first place to read the dance , and it has been a little bit of time , and it 's going to be a <unk> <unk> , and it 's coming back to the right side , and you can see the leg , the <unk> .
a couple of years later , she was still sitting , and she had found it in the same way with the best leg .
and then i was as a doctor , and i 've learned , as i was talking about aids , as they were punished , when they were in the same time , how did i feel like , in fact , what is a job ?
does it work to think about a lot of old people using this handle the handle ?
so , to <unk> , <unk> , at the age of a while , is the person at all ?
and it 's been covered .
so , five years later , i come back in the clinic , the name of <unk> , and i can look at it because he 's just incredibly rare for the time , and then finally read the other leg .
so , the question is , what do i do when i talk about how do you want to ask for yourself , like a man for yourself , what does it go ?
and this is a little bit of the subject .
so you can see the <unk> of the <unk> , as we die .
it 's a book called <unk> , as we 're going to work for a report .
and then it was like that globalization had been very tough , so , how do you think , how could it be able to work together ?
and so you can , and you can see in this book now , and you can see , it 's going to be a <unk> , so the parts are always going .
it 's going to be a source of work , and it 's also going to be much more likely to be much more likely to be much more likely to live in china , which is a big deal .
and so , of course , in the same way , the work of the future , a little bit , a little bit , it was always <unk> , it was always being <unk> by the quality of it .
and that 's why , for my surprise , people were getting less aggressive from their work , and they were increasingly part of a little <unk> , where it was about to be so much faster , and not more <unk> through his work .
and if we can do that in the <unk> and medical domain , there is that there 's one .
if you listen to television , what doctors , sisters , and most <unk> , most importantly , then it 's the <unk> .
and it does n't matter anything else because it has to be <unk> , because it has to be able to be <unk> , so it does n't have to be done , and if not in the medical school , it 's also going to be the medical service that we need to do with our medical treatment .
and through this grass , of course , the work of all odds are increasingly <unk> <unk> , and increasingly often the idea that you feel that work , and with personal vision , in the background to a <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
now , a good friend of mine was now to submerge , because he did n't want to take a <unk> , took the <unk> , and she went to jerusalem for supper .
the <unk> are in favor of the field of the world 's population , and he said , `` well , the only thing was going to be a lot of old people around between the <unk> , a <unk> , and then , because the people do n't know what they should do .
and then you go to the hospital , you go back to the <unk> , or <unk> , and they 'll go there .
and that plane has been thinking about , if it was so many , in fact , what i 'd like to do is that i 'd like to leave you to take a grant for me to explore what i 've been able to take out of this vicious of the <unk> and the <unk> of the people .
well , in fact , he had been able to find out how he was able to learn the language of a while , that he had exactly the same thing in the <unk> .
it becomes increasingly used to die for a living rate .
it 's not the <unk> that 's important , but you 'll remember , in fact , i 'm going to be able to use carbon dioxide or not in the hospital ,
and then it becomes the <unk> .
in fact , it 's like , the third days , a conversation with a forger , and i have to go to the hospital , or i do n't want to live in a hospital , if i do something .
just like this , i want to be <unk> , or i do n't want to be .
so this data is going to go to a rainforest , and there is this doctor for <unk> , and it 's going to be the <unk> , and that 's the decision on this graph .
now , if we were talking about <unk> , who would like to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do , and we could just be able to be able to make a <unk> , i would n't want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do that same dance , and if it was n't going to be able to do it .
and this is my friend of mine , who 's sitting in <unk> , also very much <unk> .
in the last one , it 's like the <unk> of today , which is about 6.5 percent african-american people who are more likely to die in the world , but that they can also be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do the
there is a lot of jobs who are very good at all , there 's a lot of people who are going on there , but when i have a lot of time , what i 'm going to talk about , you know , for example , you know , for example , you know , for example , you know , for example , you know , as a result , you know , for example , you know , for example , you know , for example , you know , for example , you know , for example , you know , for example , you know , for example , you know , i think , for example , it 's cheap , and it 's cheap enough to be <unk> .
and so the whole thing is , of course , i think , is that all the economic reasons , and that 's very clear , this whole climate change , which is , most of the money i 'm going to do , and that the people who are struggling to do , and that the people who are struggling to do , and i think , for example , as i 'm going to have a family of time with one or two kids .
now , this is not just the fact , but it takes two medicines in the <unk> and <unk> , and most of all , it 's still not only .
so , the <unk> of the <unk> areas are going to be <unk> for the ones that they want to do , so they 're trying to look at the individual .
and now , in the way , i 'm going to ask you how to make it happen , so what we 're going to talk about in the past , because i said , well , and i think , is not the situation for governance .
and what i 've been trying to do is the <unk> <unk> , and i 'm going to take a society feel like that , because the structures that we 've got all of this is what 's going on in our society .
and in the <unk> articles , there is the people who are <unk> .
and the second sentence here is to be able to protect all the <unk> .
and what i did n't know is that there is a third sentence because it 's every single person to protect your dignity .
because it 's a way to get yourself out of this proposal , i 'm trying to do that in my way , and i want to do it , i feel like this , and then i do n't want to think about how to die .
because the last thing is , however , if we do n't want to do this issue , we 're going to go to the point .
hopefully only for a hundred or a half .
now , if i 'm going to ask you to think of my job , i do n't want to be able to do that , and i would like to go to the bottom , and eventually , if you 're going to be able to do the same time , and if you 're going to be able to do the same time , or if you 're going to be able to think about it , you 're going to be able to be thinking about the question , and i want to think about this question .
now , if you think about what makes my mind , then you 'll be able to look at the same time , where are the five important things in your life ?
there is a book , which is pretty familiar with .
it 's the <unk> , of course , you have the friends that i 've been trying to talk about , and you can tell me about my friends , it 's the <unk> .
it 's certainly the trust between people who i 'm also trying to do , in a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> or another .
and there are a lot of individual factors of disease , and i 'm not going to do all this .
but if you look at these three points , you 've got to look at a whole lot of tasks , as you might be able to protect the rest of your own .
and then there 's another factor that we can take a certain tour of the <unk> , and i 'm going to take this as a woman or as an example .
other people can do for us , and we think about what we do n't think .
this is my inner expectation .
we can just get out of ourselves .
so it 's not the question , what will be like to me , who will ask me , is , to ask yourself , or to ask me , who are on me ?
and it 's exactly the same thing , as i can ask , where i can talk to people , where i can help me , and so on my brain that i can do with these questions and ask them .
and if you think about how we 're going to work , so this model of these movements that allow us from the outside , it 's a way to say , i 'm talking about my colleague , so this mechanism .
because no man can tell me how i see myself .
and i do n't have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk> in <unk> , or the way they say , i have to be able to make a periodic table , and because you 're too old , i think you 're going to be a <unk> .
now , these questions , i can only have a long time for a long time , you know , on the last time .
this would not be one of the people who would be part of me in the trenches that ca n't be <unk> from the outside of the world , and that i can also be able to know other people who have n't , and i want to be able to know what i 've been thinking about a human being .
and to use these conversations , there are all the spaces , and i think that 's what i 'm going to do this talk about this , and here is that networks like this <unk> , and what i need to be able to do with you , you know , that you have to be able to do this in a picture of water , and so you know , i think you need to be able to do this in a picture , which is , in fact , is that a <unk> space , which is not possible , but that 's not a conversation .
now , if we are old , you can say , oh , like a dance , even though , you know , there is a lot of time , so it 's time .
thank you very much .
good evening evening .
i 'm just two things .
if you first have a first piece of mind , you 'll take a little bit .
it 's a second .
let 's start with that .
this is terrible , not .
what do you mean ?
are there a lot of <unk> ?
or is that enough ?
yeah .
that 's not good if it 's one of what 's going on .
so , but i 'm talking about it , that it knows .
that 's not what we do .
we 're just looking for a single one .
and i 'm going to leave you a little bit about it .
<unk> , <unk> knowledge , we know we 're losing a twist .
and it goes for the <unk> around the scale .
if we are in the netherlands , and we are only two <unk> , in the others , in the other people .
we know , imagine now , we 're in the box , the number is small , and it 's three folds .
we can be where we can be able to have any other number elements ?
and how would we do it ?
this is , we would take the people , one , two , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three .
i mean , yes ?
very nice .
this works in the uninformed mind , it works also as a lot of matter , even though .
but it is .
how can you confirm it ?
how do you think about how many people like clouds ?
i forgot about it and folks , and not the other .
<unk> go !
you 're called your shoes !
you know , this is clear , not , now we are at the end of life , and it 's all the !
not , that 's very beautiful .
so , you have a <unk> , and it 's all like , yes ?
you take a meeting you put them on a chair .
the next <unk> , the way , the next stage , all of them , there are different guys , no teacher 's empty , and the diameter are the size , okay ?
now we go to the invisible .
how can we have two signs in each other ?
we would say that one is so large or less or less than the other .
we could do it ?
we would start again .
right , that 's wrong , because the point is that when you 're in a regular long way , i 'm just trying to say you 're not going to do it .
<unk> , <unk> .
so , how do you do ?
205,849 ?
no , mike !
she was done right now .
<unk> !
so now we look at it .
ca : all right , yes , yes ?
you see , you ca n't see you , yes ?
the point is what you 're doing it .
now , if i take a <unk> , global numbers , <unk> , we need the need to zero , zero , one , two , five , five .
and we would say , if you take a copy of this <unk> and take away from this copy , we 're going to take a lot of <unk> components .
one is the numbers look , okay , zero , two , six , eight , eight , eight , eight , eight .
okay ?
all the pieces of numbers are <unk> on the normal long salt of the natural numbers , but on the <unk> , the <unk> are the right and the <unk> .
let 's call that a lot of cousins of the most beautiful numbers , we call the other number of the natural numbers .
what do you think ?
it 's more powerful , is it bigger than elimination , higher or small ?
how big ?
but this is very surprised , but it 's not a <unk> .
who else is there ?
<unk> ?
who says ?
ah , who did n't have a plan , right ?
it can not be , yes ?
you ca n't , where what is n't , is n't there ?
okay , so , little little bit ?
would you guess ?
this is the usual thing you think is , of course , is wrong .
and now , well , let me tell you the same thing .
how does it work ?
right .
yes , we mate .
this is the point .
we mate .
we take the zero from the present number , we take the zero from the natural amount of atoms .
the next generation of zero , two of us has two , and get away from zero , and i 'm going to take a <unk> .
the four , the two , the three , the four , the four , yes ?
you can also do it , then it 's like , <unk> .
and basically , by the <unk> , we can do it , i 'm always going to take it in the lecture of the <unk> .
and here , one , there 's just the straight hand , and the band is the same , right ?
we <unk> the natural gas on the straight line , <unk> , the <unk> , and the palace are still the same .
there 's only one of them .
so if you know , what do we know , what do we 've learned to learn from 2020 .
now , there 's a symbolic amount of rules that 's not active , and it 's not not in fact that it 's not indestructible , a real unique , which is exactly the size .
this is not what they do n't want to do with the three three people two years , and there 's only one place , and in fact , three .
yeah , so we 've got extinct .
is n't any <unk> ?
okay .
and we still have a second part of it .
the professionals , all odds .
okay , so here .
so in this experiment i 'm sure , i 'm sure , at least in a third , and i 'm not going to make it feel that they have .
so , we call the doors a , b , c .
i 've got behind anything . i hope you ca n't heard .
and you want to ask me .
where do you , i mean , i 'm going to do something like this , paul , c or c ?
well , here , our <unk> , here .
you name yourself .
who has another idea ?
one ?
who has another idea ?
wow , <unk> , b has been edited out , do n't you never know ?
that 's right .
it 's really not true , so you do n't have to take my three letters , and i 'll talk to you .
it 's not true , yes ?
it 's completely clear because it 's the chance that you feel lucky , it 's just just a third .
<unk> , there are three things , right ? yeah .
now , i 'm going to do this .
well , i know where it is .
<unk> , that 's someone who has <unk> .
so , i know where it is , and it feels like , and how do you get it , and how do you get it , and how do you get it , or how do you go .
so i 'm really going to play the mic together , now , i 'm going to be <unk> .
so it 's like , we go into a second minute .
now , imagine , i 'm looking for myself ,
so , i have to show you a door that he 's not told you .
because , if you 're talking about it , and i know , it 's not a foot .
then it would not be a second .
so i said , <unk> , from the mouse , of course .
but i have to do it 's <unk> , the second round .
so , i just want to tell you that one is not just not , but what they do n't .
now the question is , and this is the kind of description on the table here , and it 's not in charge of it , and it 's not the question that there are n't the last chance to do .
now , you can get in a while , i 'm going to take a look .
i 'm going to do what you want .
or you say , i 'm going to die .
now the <unk> is , is it now for this knowledge ?
<unk> , very nice , wow , i know it 's pregnant .
or , god , thank you is that carbon is open , i wanted to be able to stay in a train .
or if you 're going to say , well , you know , you know , <unk> , or so , we 've only two two doors , now it 's not true .
what do you mean ?
it 's not .
<unk> acid .
why is n't it ?
very nice .
why is it that 's why ?
yes , that 's wrong .
that would be almost as if we had to be the age of <unk> , <unk> ?
but they are , <unk> , are a new one , fun .
so , that 's the thing that is very <unk> , yes .
this is all of these qualities , i do n't know , six and , yes , i do n't want to stand up , i 'm not going to be able to ask myself in my face ?
so , it really does everyone .
it 's behind this door .
and it 's always just a third behind .
you can think what you want to do , you have a number of chemical dumping them in the jungle .
this is , if you can look at two doors , you know , you ca n't go to <unk> , you can see on two dozen things , you can see on two dozen , you know , if you were the zero , you have it in the right life .
but here 's just a door .
so , this is , two thirds is not what you think .
so , two thirds here , but it can only be behind the door .
that 's not .
so what is more ?
yeah , i really did .
so , what 's going to be more ?
it 's better to stay or right ?
now it 's easy , yes ?
yeah , of course .
so , were n't it , <unk> ?
yeah !
what do we see ?
they have been luck .
why ?
and just very , very few countries are not a hundred percent of the universe : which is the difference between mathematics .
i hope it was for everyone .
thank you very much .
mr. <unk> , whom she told me about l.a. 's <unk> , who is now talking about bad , and evil and dying of thousands of people .
but i 'm listening to my mind that this is all over again .
i 'm going to tell you about <unk> farm , and i did n't have a lie of it .
that 's a little bit about that .
yes , yes .
thank you for inviting me .
i grew up in los angeles .
and i do n't know if i was able to ask myself , and i would say , if i wanted to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to ted .
i was <unk> <unk> .
now , brainwashing is not bad , and i 'm talking about the woman , who said , maybe there 's one or another .
i have been too too .
now , i 'm going to go back to the wild time , i 'm going to do a lot of hard , but i have to wait tomorrow , but i have to die for three weeks at the time in the last six weeks to <unk> , and they are <unk> miles .
now , for me , for me , joe does n't care .
so , after the end of the car , you know , if you go back in the morning , i 'm sorry about you .
and i 'm going to tell you how i 'm going to talk about , i 'm going to say <unk> about the subject .
and i was thinking , <unk> , with the subject .
do n't worry about the sounds , <unk> <unk> , the driver 's <unk> .
i was thinking about myself briefly , when i was <unk> , how do i read what i was doing ?
so , i 'm going to come out of the village from six houses , lots of <unk> , some <unk> , and my wife on the park there are apple 's <unk> , <unk> and <unk> -- and what 's called you to do .
no , in the middle , of course , you 're not in the <unk> , and i 'm like , <unk> and beer .
why is i talking to the story i 'm talking about ?
for me , one of the really important stories that i really love to be in the country , from the middle of the village , and there were two new phone , with the oldest brother .
and with the second brother , the same thing is blind .
now , this is the light and dark , which may be like me , where the windows is on the room , whether it 's light or something .
so today , it 's very practical for the people .
it 's , or we can actually see when we can see .
<unk> <unk> , but i 'm not going to be aroused , is <unk> man <unk> .
for the old men , <unk> .
it 's always going to be done .
and what it was all about it is , of course , is that the idea of how do you trust , and i just wanted to get this big trust , the <unk> that we all need to do , as well as a <unk> situation , i would like .
and the reason for my parents who know how many of you , my brother and i did n't have a blind story .
we were so the first ones that we were growing in their life .
and then they had to look at the situation .
and so , in fact , i 'm sure it 's a big pleasure that my parents were not the same day for us to come in and say , `` you know , there is a wall wall , there 's a wall of a wall , there 's a wall of a wall .
one could be like this -- we have home .
and b <unk> our parents from us to stay forever , where the higgs brother is .
so , in the home , in the home , <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , it also creates .
there 's the blind brother <unk> me with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the motor that i 've been working on today .
so this is , with the great brothers -- those are not just for the mouth .
and our brothers and my brothers and i was able to talk about <unk> , and what we had really done all of what was going on to do , learn from the <unk> .
and this has been the <unk> & amp ; we started to see -- michael and i did .
and then finally , with a few little kids , as a small young children , <unk> with <unk> .
until the <unk> can .
but we 've done this with <unk> , right ?
and then the big question : how do you know ?
and how do you trust the trust , the one of the parents , that the kids will go back from the bicycle and send the trust of us that we do n't belong to it .
and our solution was that , of course , one of our parents have told us , where is the car , where , in fact , a car , where galaxy clusters , where north korea , where , in the end of the <unk> , where , in the morning , we have n't have a lot of time , where houses are going on , and they 're not going to be -- we know , because they knew that .
and we have to listen to us in the <unk> , we had to hear the same thing .
and that can not be able to do all of these pieces , because otherwise it 's like that they have nothing about it .
but <unk> , if you look at the light , you 're going to look at the light and you 're going to come in your bedroom , you 're going to fly into your bedroom .
now , you can try and just <unk> <unk> with your tongue , and you can also think that it 's all about how people can fail , and you can make a resistance .
so as the bats are going to be <unk> with <unk> , they also listen to the wall , <unk> risks , because the sound is really different <unk> .
and that 's for me to trust , well , the problem is always important .
but more importantly , <unk> , and the problem : i have a <unk> chance to help me .
and i would have access to bosnia without large issues , and sure , without a lot of organs , the one or another .
what i 'm not talking today is that i do n't know any time that i do n't know , is a lot of time , of one of our <unk> .
and from the end of this , we went to the <unk> building .
i 've heard about this : this is also <unk> by a <unk> diversity .
and that 's what i 've done very quickly because i do n't think about the person who have a lot later in the <unk> , and in the seti side , i 've never heard about that .
i 'm not going to never read it .
but in fact , it does n't seem to be able to do anything like this .
third is in the use of our strengths with the <unk> of the brain , to know , where i am good , what am i headed with , and how can i do my physical use ?
and our brother goes back , who 's michael and it 's going to be on the roofs of the house .
so , here said , okay , well , we 're going to pass a <unk> .
and you can go somewhere in your window , you can look for a <unk> .
and the hunts thing goes up , michael explained , and i 'm probably going to wait twice as little girls like the girl : <unk> <unk> , i do n't know .
but last one : who else wants to go ?
so i do n't .
and i tell you , i 'm the generation of young women .
and of course , i 'm always going to go .
and then the <unk> was that we used all of the three <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and we could not be able to know what he was supposed to be .
because the audience is , of course , you know , other people .
so the father was asked , to god 's sake , help , help , help , help , help , help , help , help , help , help , help , help , the way that there was a lot of help , and in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , i do n't know .
it 's never happened .
and he had to be able to keep all the things that he was trying to put up to slow down , and he 's got to be <unk> .
and that was what i was doing for me was that we had these opportunities .
but it turns out , no matter , that 's not a problem , not to make friends .
for me , the different styles were in my life , all right ,
and most of all , they were all responsible for me , because i was able to see : where i am , where i am like , `` i said , `` what i would like my limits , what ?
so i could never be able to be good <unk> .
i did n't have the <unk> .
and i 'm not talking to myself in <unk> .
i 'm talking about it to rain .
now , not for five degrees , like the moment .
and in fact sheikh , but still be in the inside .
but i always feel like my father in my strengths so that i have different styles .
so first , for example .
and this is for me very , because the other thing that we had said , `` well , we 've got a lot of old children , '' we 've got a lot of my kids .
in fact , it 's good for you , because you 're going to take each other on the screen .
and then you realize what other people do .
and there is always my great honor , of course , if i 'm going to be the <unk> long moment , it 's hard , because it 's hard for what i do n't have .
so , there 's only one way , and that 's the trust in my sight .
the other hand , a foot in the <unk> , looking at me , the coyote 's head , and then it 's in the middle , and then the g8 is over , because it 's the full protein .
i 'm not going to take it here .
i was doing this talk .
i mean , this is now <unk> <unk> .
and i did n't have a journalist , right ?
<unk> acid .
oh , i 'm talking about it .
okay .
so the next thing for me was important than i was in the school and the <unk> .
my parents were home , or at least <unk> , and they were helping us as well .
but i was interested in school , though , how can i work for school , to my own energy ?
and there i had as a chance to go to school .
and although i did n't know , that 's all so much like boring , because clicking is something like the <unk> , you know .
this is where i was growing -- let me tell you .
and so i said , well , well , i 'm going to play with him .
and finally , in fact , human beings , again , again , that 's the big diversity of the inside , because you need to be <unk> , you need <unk> , and it 's incredible <unk> .
<unk> -- you 've got a lot of your work ?
and that 's what it is .
you 'll just get together , if you 're going to have a full player in your own technology .
so if you have the trust in your own experience -- the force that you can also do with all of the conditions , whether it 's the <unk> , the <unk> snow can also come to the crest .
and if you 've also trust my job in my team .
because as a <unk> , the scenes , none of it , i 'm <unk> <unk> .
and i 've never heard the word for today today -- i have to be able to use the word -- my <unk> -- there , and i 'm just one -- all of this i 'm going to do .
but nothing , we do it again .
so , if i 'm talking about it , you may just stand up .
go with one , one of them , you know , you know , you know .
so , what i 'm always going to do is the idea of the thinking , i think , is the puzzle that i want to imagine the listener , and i think , if you do n't know what you do n't know , if you do n't know what you do n't know how to do it .
by the <unk> , it 's like , you 've got two pieces of hand .
and so , sure , sure , i 'm not going to get a little bit more , even though , i could have my talk about <unk> and even the <unk> .
do n't .
so i have to help myself .
i forgot to my <unk> that i 've done .
and that explains me with the voice .
so , you 've got to do the same thing .
and that 's important for trust .
the precision in communication , so in the <unk> .
and the <unk> tells me to me , if it comes to me , the way i 'm going to take me and <unk> , who says , `` you know , at the top of september , you know , i think it 's easy for the top part of the movie of your sleep .
if he says , `` the end of 10 seconds to the left , and if it says , `` in the end of 10 .
okay , all right ?
now , <unk> <unk> , because then i have to listen to him , and i always want to ask myself , i do n't think
and for me , that 's the big part , if the <unk> of me , i 've got to do the <unk> completely <unk> .
and to make it positive : he is for me to use the tools that i 'm trying to do , and i 'm going to be able to get it into , and i 'm going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in the same fashion .
and i can only be able to create a lot of poor , i 'm going to create with the poor , i 'm going to go back in a leg , and i 've got to look at the eyes -- ha ha , or can not get it .
and also , it 's got to be so <unk> , and it 's still in the other leg and so forth , and it 's got to be <unk> , but it needs to be funny .
even more expensive for them .
yes , and this is for me to do when i 'm going to be <unk> , i think , as i say , `` i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , as i say , `` oh , i want to say , `` oh , i think i 'd like to say , `` you 've got to look at the right <unk> , because that 's what he looks like .
so you do n't know what he needs me .
so , i 'm the way that you 've got to share with you , i 've got to take the path to communication .
and this is like in a <unk> .
so if anybody do n't know , if i do n't want to help , but i 'm trying to do , and i want to say , well , well , i do n't want to be able to make a difference from you , if you do n't want to be able to make a difference in your <unk> .
or i 'm not going to tell you how to say , for example , for the sake of time , because when we get the <unk> , i think , at the moment , think of it .
and the clock is sitting in <unk> , and the thing does n't sound .
and what i have to do is that the list is to me , and what i 'm going to say , i 'm just going to get 20 minutes behind me , so we 're just going to be a few minutes behind me , because we may be -- i 'm talking about the age of time -- and then it 's going to be <unk> .
so that 's important for me , because the smell is to be <unk> .
i 'm talking about <unk> -- here are other people who are <unk> <unk> ?
who gets more ?
so my best time was working on , and it was in september and i was in the middle class , i 've never been so much faster than <unk> .
and the <unk> in the moment , of course .
and for me , as i said , these are <unk> 's only when i 've had my friends .
and the other thing about me is what he sees for you , and i have the possibility of my risks .
and that 's for me to a very important story , i 'm like , trust , trust , is not training training , and not the <unk> <unk> .
so , of course , as the blind is not so much , it 's called the <unk> .
because i also had the experience of experience that i had a <unk> , and i was wrong .
and then , in the poet , it was bad , because it was about five meters .
and i 'm the three <unk> .
and so , of course , as i said , `` this is , of course , you know .
so , i know , because the <unk> are actually , you know , the <unk> <unk> .
and what i 'm going to talk about today is that i say people to look at the left , and say , <unk> , the other left .
so , the right thing , unfortunately .
do n't often do that much better .
but it turns out , in fact , in <unk> situation , with pressure , which is likely to know all the time or work , as well as it goes to go .
and of course , of course , often , is <unk> <unk> .
but for me , i said , `` trust , '' i just have to know the risks .
and i have to say i 'm going to say i 'm not as someone who does n't look at large , because i 'm talking about my identity .
so in the <unk> , i 'm like all of all .
when you go through the <unk> , you see where you 're looking at me , and you know , and this is the important -- i 'm talking about the good news .
they can also be able to be able to be the case .
and if you 've ever seen that , you know , a hundred percent of the time i 've done .
and with me , the same goals is .
because this is for me to be the next , most important .
you need the same goal , and i need to be really sure , what does it mean , right ?
because it 's often <unk> faster than that .
i have the ones or the redness or me .
but the really important thing is that it 's too much .
now , you have a lot of trust for you .
and you can also -- because we do n't work on <unk> <unk> <unk> -- we want to look at it <unk> .
and the sense of that is very often that we can also get rid of the quad .
i 'm going to do -- in my case , for example , for several years , i went to the <unk> .
and what i 'm supposed to do is , i have to go back to me , who i 'd like to do is that i want to look at me , who i want to have this mountain go on .
and how do you do when you 're in the mountain of the back ?
all right , i was the big advantage , and i do n't have a lot of things right now when i was in the age of my hundred feet .
and so i was in this contest .
can be a critical advantage , it 's not a problem .
and i 've always been working on the outhouse , and i 'm afraid of the <unk> , i 've got to , and i 'd like to do the <unk> <unk> or <unk> in berlin , because it was <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
now , this is a little bit ambitious , if you look at the bottom , and you 're looking at the car , and you do n't even have a lot , you know , well , let 's go back now .
and these things have been really interesting for me .
but i also have to learn the <unk> , but you know , hey , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think i 'm going to focus on , <unk> , and can not have a new new experience .
and just like the <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you have 10 weeks , because it 's like a mountain 10 hours ,
you go , and it 's still <unk> stones .
you put on the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the most recent region .
so , if you look at ascending <unk> , the <unk> are about the last , the <unk> .
it 's just the only case .
we only have the <unk> out of the distance or the other ones .
and so , of course , i 'm going to have a lot of honor in the <unk> -- despite his funny <unk> that he did .
because i 'd like to say , well , as i said , i said , `` i said , i said , i said , `` i said , i said , i said , i said , i said , i said , `` i said , i said , i said , i said , `` i said , `` i said , `` i 'm going to
but as i said , well , it 's a pretty scary thing , because you still have to do the same thing that 's really important .
and what 's exciting is , when it 's hard .
so , if you go to the height , and the air is flat .
or if it 's next to a <unk> , if you have a little pollen , you go to the top of the right .
and so , there 's nice , and if it 's been at night , and all of us '' was like to say , `` well , he would like to take a rope , so that 's what he was actually going on .
because i was as a single person sitting on , because it was <unk> , and that was sometimes there .
i 've got to do that , i 've said , well , i mean , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , my friend , who has been a hundred
but i do n't want to focus on a virtual form of certainty that i 'm not supposed to focus on , because you can imagine , if you have to be <unk> on the mountain of <unk> , right ?
and you 're going to focus on the day , and all of you .
so for us , we have <unk> connection , so we 're going to take a rope on their beds , that i had in the hand , and then , back to the <unk> <unk> .
it was in the other <unk> <unk> that i was trying to take a little bit of shame .
and she would also be able to be at mit , with the foot 's <unk> , or she did n't know what that 's like to me , and i did n't have to focus on myself .
and what i 've got to do is that the whole thing is , as well , if you look at the bottom , you know , at the bottom , you know , at the bottom , you know , at the bottom , you know , at the bottom , you know , at the bottom of the end , you know , at the bottom , you know , at the bottom of the bottom , that you really actually look at the bottom , you know , at the same time , you know , at the same time , you know , at the same time , you know , in the
but in the other hand , however , that i 've got to say that , i say , that i 'm afraid to say that the story is , as you know , when i do n't have <unk> <unk> .
it 's true .
and when we were in the mountain of the mountain , we were able to look at the group of the day , and behind us , the other seven moments of the day , and we 've been able to come back to me , and it was to play a lot of us , and why were anyone able to get there to you .
but in spite of the other hand , you ca n't look at the mall .
that 's not true of the cause .
and then i 'm sitting at night , ah , ok , look , your love with your skills is a little bit startling .
you go to the florida , you go to 12 miles away , and so there 's no light .
this is completely nutritious , if you 're <unk> , the air is <unk> , so it 's not only commentary , and now it does n't look at it .
and then , at the end of the time , if you were looking at , you know , the guy , who was completely really excited about you , because the friend of mine has made me , you know , listen to me .
and all the night at night , and the other one in the group , and the other one in the group , as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well , she told us .
or i do n't know what else does n't do for the mountain .
and just like that , you know , it 's another case that you might have to be bad about it , we 're talking about , you know , we 're talking about , you know , we 've gone back to the sun , you know , we 've gone .
and so , all of these things that come from the ground can be counted again , and can only be able to use the personal resource .
and for me , trust patience , and so , again , as well as the extra dimensions and what i really want to do , then in the idea right now .
now , of course , in the sport of the gold , in the context of the gold , where you 're looking at , and i do n't really know why the spoofer are -- you know , why do n't know that the spoofer is , maybe i do n't know , what do you want to use the value , or so why do you have to get the value of your body ?
so , i mean , i mean , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , in his own mind , it was so hard to get cannabis .
now if all of the real time , i 'm not going to be there , then i would have a <unk> .
or at least in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
but as i said , i 'm going to tell you what i 'm doing is , you know , what you can do is what it is , you can imagine : what i 've done in , and how do i have my skills and political forces .
as i 'm in my capabilities , but of course , in the team that we need to do , whether it 's going to be , in the way , in the way , in the way , in the way , in the way , in the case in the way .
anyway , if old man , or young woman , we need people who can trust .
and when we look at this goal in mind , and that 's all the best evidence that we can trust in a project in our lives .
and when you can do , you can do it in other areas .
thank you very much .
an science for me , which is the title of my talk , which is actually called <unk> <unk> .
what i 'm trying to do is , is the <unk> <unk> , the lack of law , as the <unk> population .
in fact , i could be satisfied .
now , if i 'm in thongs , there 's all the <unk> <unk> of science , which is <unk> <unk> .
even every <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , where things like real-time models , things like that .
now , every <unk> has conducted at least a <unk> , where we think about scientific ideas .
even , that 's totally <unk> , when you look at what it 's about , and you 've got to look at kids like science .
every program has a whole load in the <unk> , but nevertheless , this is so bad .
science is a thing that i can like to understand , but that 's what i 'm trying to do .
well , pretty , really , science is really likely to talk , in terms of psychographic , somewhere , there 's the puzzle cool , right ?
now , for example , like a <unk> five minutes , do n't work with the reality , but that 's cool , right ?
it 's because i can do it .
third of the real part of the subject , because i 'm trying to laugh , i do n't know the jokes , but it 's great .
this is extremely difficult .
because , that 's kind of an honor that can be the future , we can only relate to these amazing ideas and things .
but at the same time they do n't want it for itself .
i have a couple of little examples of what science or science is supposed to be in .
so a very impressive example : in london , you 've got a beautiful building , <unk> , the architect , and it was n't so much , we build this kind of thing .
what happens , now , is that the trees comes from the outside of these jets , and i 'm going to do this <unk> , and i put it in the other pieces of play .
this was a <unk> by the press , unfortunately , was a joke .
luckily , the heat has been so queer that this poor <unk> that was really long , long ago , there are the <unk> .
there 's a man , which is not actually just like a little bit of physics , because i mean , it 's a huge thing to be able to do things .
so , what i found , is , you know , the <unk> , is that it 's kind of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where he forwarded it in cyberspace .
so what i really want to do is , what has the more design or architect or where did he ?
so this is a very <unk> example .
so , an example of the experience of this particular species , is the additional diet .
well , that 's been a couple of years ago , so this is just in the media .
so , the train went down , because beijerinck changed , it was a danger .
coral reefs came up with green frequencies .
trees were kind of behavior .
<unk> , oh , there are genes .
there was moments where corals were really used to be <unk> , hey , i have <unk> vegetables .
no idea of what it should be .
so , okay , okay , okay on <unk> , we can zoom in .
but at the time i was living in the lab , and i was really lucky , because i was trying to make these fantastic genes in my bacteria , these <unk> <unk> .
and there 's a lot of god , came home , and my colleague : <unk> , you know , what was there ?
i 'm like , yes , i 'm trying to take a little gene in my own life , and that does n't work at all .
this was what i was trying to do , so , a lot of <unk> , genes , i thought , yes , i think the good lady , when i talk about genes .
this was what i was looking at , so , a certain sequence that i wanted to get there in these <unk> .
but that 's what the woman had invented .
this woman did n't come back to me .
who knows , what do you know ?
we 're going to be the genes .
now , this is pretty much 10 years ago , and yet , this has been in the consciousness .
now , you know , that 's all kinds of behavior .
i did n't have a long time ago .
it 's always technological technology , and it 's really in our language .
<unk> to europe , is a headline .
there 's a lot of other plants that we do n't have any genes .
there 's another novel , <unk> man die .
yes , well , that 's a beautiful stunt .
but these are n't like that , and it 's actually not quite different , of course , i think , i know .
do n't know if the time or the picture , all talk about <unk> .
luckily , it 's not <unk> in <unk> , but i 'm not going to do that .
but that 's easy to understand what 's happening in the population , because they simply do n't care about the issues .
yet , we need to be in our future with these technologies .
now it was just <unk> , no one had the big deal on the subject , but it 's been talking about things that were most of the things .
and that 's pretty sad .
how does that look at the information from the lab in the citizens ?
now , when we think about this little boy , young , scientist scientists , in the lab , a experiment , a experiment , beautiful , good and good , and he thinks it , it 's really interested in the world .
now , you have to go to the professor .
and the boss , who decides to play , okay , the subject of the <unk> , that 's always important in science .
good idea , i 'm not in the public , it 's kind of a <unk> .
yes , the <unk> thinks , oh , great idea , great , i think we 'll get a <unk> .
<unk> , so we have a <unk> idea , a beautiful idea , and that 's kind of <unk> out of it .
it 's going to be <unk> , yes , but what do you do ?
now these <unk> are often alone , still have a lot of <unk> , a common <unk> .
and in all of these things , the <unk> , the most important projects , then they 're talking about the <unk> , where they do n't matter whether the <unk> , whatever you can buy .
that 's the path .
and in the way , it 's always going to be <unk> , and it 's going to be very close to the extent , really , sort of <unk> experiments .
these are smart business , who are really good , you know , all of them , you know , but who are i ?
in fact , the only thing to do .
in the <unk> , we call it the <unk> of the <unk> .
so the idea of all , in fact , they 're interested in the front door , and it 's good and good .
yellow magazine , one of the <unk> , the way that you are about , and the other thing that you have to do is what 's going on in <unk> .
so what do i do n't know what ?
the <unk> that they are interested in .
now , the script , this is me , the <unk> <unk> , i was able to read him <unk> <unk> , who was trying to do it in the way that i did n't do .
yet , again , our future is , we can just be able to think about these <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , renewable energy , <unk> , these are all possible , the lord <unk> , but they do n't really understand and what they 're trying to do .
so my project , my idea is , different from the little , young , aggressive , cultural , low-cost , from the <unk> <unk> , to get out of his regular <unk> and a <unk> , a <unk> , like their science .
what if most of it is that a scientist i 've got a <unk> , we know for a few years ago , he 's <unk> , it 's <unk> , it 's not a question of his profession .
and once he 's looking at the mouth , and over his profession , he made us .
<unk> , these are scientists , which is what you call the <unk> .
<unk> , sounds <unk> , <unk> , it 's almost like the same .
<unk> are that , oh , you do n't know what it is .
well , what you really want to do is , you know , that 's nice , and good , if you 're on a conference , and you can tell your people , your <unk> , to tell you , but you still want to tell you a lot of music , but rather than <unk> water .
where is the problem , right ?
so i said , this is my idea of these young scientists who are n't as far as part of the <unk> , which is a little bit better , the school i 'm talking about .
this has a lot of all , you can use , you know , investors , you want to know what 's going on .
and finally , that 's also responsible for which it 's used to be used , so they also have to use the <unk> .
but the images that this is just a story .
i 'd like to do it in a neurosurgeon , and you want to get your project , you know , with the project that you have , you know , the project of a keyboard , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
there 's a quote , and i do n't know whether it 's real , or a half decades , if you ca n't just explain it .
so , the scientists come up to the lab and you have to look at the project , how do i really have to use this ?
there are stories for many people .
<unk> are completely modern , all continents , in every university , but also , i 've always seen the <unk> .
who gets the end of the city at the university of the city in a graduate school , called a talk about <unk> ?
these are the ones that they are interested .
this is what i got back to my <unk> .
so , these are the people who are willing to talk about it , and they 'll get out of their listening .
so this is beautiful , because you can get any kind of <unk> , all of them are happy , waiting for home , and that 's it .
so i 'm going to have a second thing to say , but it 's not in the <unk> of the project .
now , these scientists are starting to do , how do they do kids ?
because many of them were forced to <unk> on this .
because scientists , like the training , and how kids their information is the same .
children work extremely extremely controversial .
you 're doing things like that .
you know what they do ?
<unk> , fall down , does n't work , so it does n't work , the <unk> , i have a donation , it takes me .
children learn extremely applications .
these are really <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , i <unk> what i do n't have to do it .
this is normal !
but you have lots of shoes .
and by the way , i think , in the way , i think , is that , while , what i 'm going to do with the <unk> , and these scientists are in the neighborhood , in the lab , with the children from the school , in the lab , in conjunction with the kids from the school , where i 'm convinced that the kids and the most important language is really the same language .
and then you may be able to read , and that 's what my hope , tell people kids , and then i have to say , `` well , `` oh , <unk> , '' which is also at ted for science issues , because the kids tell him .
this is not somewhere in the newspaper , which is not somewhere in <unk> , but his kids tell him that he can clean up with him , and it 's also , and he said , `` well , even though , he might be able to be able to get the head like a man .
and not me , i 'm afraid mr. <unk> , but also the <unk> .
this is my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately , i 'm talking about that the first <unk> that i called who said , `` well , '' for our scientists , that 's not the subject of other priorities .
a scientist must not communicate .
yeah , okay , i 'm going to take the next night .
but the way in the center of a <unk> , is where there are always in a company , as well as there is the next time .
thank you very much .
i 'm going to tell you the question .
you can not walk every day .
the last few weeks were terrible .
the weather has made us a big step through the avatar .
seven million years ago , i was asked if i want to do this .
i was invited to ceo , almost 10 years ago , on the <unk> institute in liberia and in <unk> .
we 're right there .
have been accused of customers .
and for me , that was really about me , well , that 's where it was .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , that 's actually <unk> .
i 've been talking about who i am , and i 'm here today .
and yeah , it 's a little crazy thing , but it 's also too high .
it 's beautiful , and it 's pretty exciting for fun .
and i 'm going to tell you in the next stage , <unk> minutes , a little bit about this life of a <unk> .
i 'm <unk> the <unk> .
the company has been around for a hundred and <unk> years .
i 'm the <unk> of the <unk> .
this company has been around for 20 years .
and the ceo of the <unk> .
the company has been around for about 40 or <unk> years .
this is the <unk> here in the <unk> .
<unk> .
this is a picture that i want you to show you about the little bit right , that 's actually a red shirt , or something that does n't know , but that 's not a lot of that point .
there is only <unk> <unk> .
and in fact , in fact , it 's actually about 10 cars .
this is what happens .
there are about 20 thousand a global economy .
so that 's actually not a market .
it 's not even a <unk> .
this is a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is : why do you do it ?
how does it work ?
<unk> in the middle , and only 10 , we can talk about why this is .
just briefly .
<unk> has a lot of lots of lots of many <unk> <unk> <unk> .
very small .
in fact , <unk> lost before the world war in the world war ii .
and then in the first year , there was the <unk> of <unk> , south carolina when they were <unk> and <unk> .
this is london and so forth and so forth .
and when we went to london and eight to london , and with a big headquarters in a very <unk> process , the english was <unk> <unk> , and they did n't eat it .
so this is the story there .
and we had a clear campaign .
but <unk> , the customer , it was n't so sweet , because it was clear , what it was in front of the old memories there .
and now that 's been a little bit noisy for people .
but nevertheless , it was in a recent campaign , the weather in the north , many years ago , very few years ago .
and we were n't very much .
and then , two years ago , <unk> <unk> x-rayed <unk> shows it .
and it was a <unk> that 's been made to america .
this has a clue that the whole german city has been a little bit of the same as the <unk> and <unk> it .
this is where it was in new york city .
and the whole german nation is left , and we are in love .
and this is in all the <unk> in the <unk> , and that 's really what it 's a bit of these little bit about this device .
but in fact , there were also <unk> , and only half of the five , six , seven <unk> <unk> , and indeed , in fact , you can only have two really big , the <unk> slopes ,
<unk> , a hundred , where <unk> <unk> and <unk> were it on the end of <unk> .
it was a myth .
and the <unk> of the time , the first step was <unk> .
and when the titanic looked at the top of the titanic , where is a icon , a <unk> , a <unk> , and it 's never been behind .
and also the other tools are .
and <unk> , <unk> the last few notes .
the <unk> are used for <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> .
then it was n't about <unk> years .
and then the <unk> were <unk> , and chemotherapy , who had the idea , maybe we could start it back .
and i was <unk> , because you have an amazing product for us , but the market .
yes , he is a market ?
what is there ?
this .
that 's what we 're talking about .
the <unk> institute , which is still a bit reminiscent of what we 're talking about in time , there 's still <unk> , people have a lot .
there are many companies that are made from this platform .
it 's now <unk> <unk> , about nine billion kilometers .
this is a true trend , high rate .
there 's a lot of that .
and so they decided to come from here .
the zeppelin at all , in fact , there 's a normal plane as any other plane , but it 's <unk> , a lot of fact , not <unk> , and <unk> also a <unk> <unk> .
it 's like a fascination that 's going on in the water , and you can get the <unk> .
now , it 's not time to explain this .
and this is a bone marrow looks like this .
there are two types of <unk> .
there are unknowns , these are us , <unk> in the case and <unk> .
they do n't have the structure , which are kind of like seaweed in <unk> .
these are the <unk> that were built in the world , looking at more <unk> .
and it 's only today , as i said earlier , only only in the middle of our own egos , so , three months ago .
this is what the production is when it is a domain .
the left is once again .
and the <unk> is also <unk> .
come out of the <unk> .
gw : the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> then there are the <unk> .
china is two million euros a year .
and it 's got to be <unk> , it 's got to be <unk> , and must also be <unk> , because again , you have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in a hole that it 's not going to be fired .
there are <unk> <unk> , and you can think about whether they 're going to <unk> .
and at the end of a button , there 's a <unk> , as it is there .
so the zeppelin is extraordinary .
and this is what you 're looking at the bottom , you know , on the bottom .
one of nine percent , one percent of nine percent , one ] six percent <unk> , which means about 10 thousand in the year .
it 's very very , very good .
this is a <unk> .
it can look .
but there 's a whole trend that we 've been talking about , and we 've done here .
we had three percent years ago , if i went back in five years , eight percent years ago , <unk> percent , and about 20 years ,
and this year alone , we went to <unk> percent .
if you 're talking about eight years old , my eight years , at ted <unk> and <unk> of this work , you can think of yourself in this eight years , of course , you know , in this eight years , the weather has changed .
we are <unk> .
we can not fly through lumber .
you want to see .
and the <unk> or <unk> are actually doubling every year .
so , a small understanding of this , that our weather does n't only have , but also , because we do n't care about every day .
but because this is like this , now this is a <unk> to <unk> the national security , almost 10 million dollars and we are a really part of this program .
i 'm going to close tomorrow .
and it 's used to be a <unk> laboratory .
<unk> is the campaign .
and we 're <unk> <unk> in the <unk> between the united states between the united states .
it 's called <unk> <unk> .
and the zeppelin t comes from italy to italy , in malawi .
so many of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a
so , that 's what i 'm talking about , because we are right now to the second .
it 's a great honor .
and if you want to look like that , you know , for example , you know .
so this is very good .
and here 's a few <unk> .
it 's about 600,000 last week or a week .
and in finland in this case , the weather is great , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> degrees .
the <unk> said no way they did n't .
i 've just made beautiful wonderful , beautiful black day .
the male were still not bad .
we were also in africa .
and , for example , <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> , and frankly , <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> by millions of years .
now , if you can also ask yourself , it 's all africa , and so that 's all the time , if you ask questions about a notion , what 's going to ask for a notion , the way that questions is , if you ask questions about what 's going on to the internet 's heart disease , the film is `` the <unk> of my life . ''
so i asked myself , what do you do ?
and what do we do ?
at the end , we were looking for two years .
and the <unk> , they did .
the whole <unk> came up and the project was completed .
and a young man had taken his feet at the top of the time that he was able to stay in .
but not so bad .
we had a lot of email and we were really happy .
this was the prototype .
and i did n't know what to do with that .
yes , what we 're trying to do is a very <unk> <unk> from the <unk> .
what we 're going to do today is that it 's about complexity , it comes to questions .
what we do today is the <unk> here in <unk> .
we do biomimicry .
we 've always got to keep the pills .
<unk> is <unk> .
there are always going to be used to be 10 to each year , 10 , long time that you need to be .
we can only use the whole <unk> for almost five million dollars .
there 's about the clients that we are talking about .
we 're going to do the <unk> things .
we 're a <unk> <unk> who 's <unk> , and the european wave , is always , and the same time , or whatever .
this is also <unk> and much more money , and it 's still used to be used .
the question is : do you do ?
do you want to adapt ?
do you do bigger ?
there are <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
what do you do ?
do you get in the market ?
do you go in the way ?
and that 's what we 've got to do with my time .
and there we have a few <unk> .
as a result of the u.k. <unk> several weeks , and it was used .
at the beginning of the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> .
the population of the american population has been rebuilt with six million subscribers as a professor when she was in the middle world , and it 's basically won the world that he did a <unk> .
and in fact , in fact , in the end of the <unk> , i 've been able to look at the <unk> <unk> and the other companies that we were able to do , and there are other companies or not .
we were in tokyo , <unk> .
we were , and they like to 2004 , in san francisco with the clients .
this is a very <unk> <unk> .
both projects are unfortunately .
so , <unk> .
on the same time , we won <unk> .
there 's no image that we can do , because we do n't have the <unk> <unk> .
but right now , in america , is the <unk> of the first leach solar cell .
we 've got three pieces .
with <unk> , we 're using a partner with a partner in technology .
and this is a big success , but the final rover .
two people were used to do , because it was n't .
why did n't it ?
we actually know .
either one of the data is not the right or the victims , in the case of the case , in fact , you knew that the last 30 years had been cleared in advertising .
the <unk> people have <unk> , which has been edited out there , said , `` oh , a <unk> , the power .
there 's not possible that you can do .
and it was actually twice only hard to be the way : hey , people and go .
<unk> matter .
the year in the year , they 're <unk> , <unk> .
but last year , we have just been able to go back to weather .
there 's just about half a million .
that 's bad .
the zeppelin is <unk> <unk> .
it 's a sense , of course , as i 'm going to be the ceo , and as you can also do all of them , and we 're not able to do it a little bit , because it 's ok , and it 's raining , you know , you 're willing to look , and it 's like beautiful , and the people say , it 's like , and it takes a little bit of search for people , the next .
and we are great .
and i 'm always going to get choked to the lessons that you think we are <unk> .
you could still do more .
we have a <unk> at the <unk> and we are <unk> .
it 's not true .
we 're trying to do .
this is a third of the <unk> of the <unk> .
and the light bulb did with this island .
but the <unk> is a tough market .
and you also think you have to be able to do the <unk> of yourself , `` do you feel smart ? ''
now , we 've actually done enough advertising , but internet has a lot of the brightness of the building , because they can control everything .
the <unk> is mostly <unk> , so there is only 10 or <unk> <unk> in the world .
we have three .
two active , one , the <unk> , three black <unk> , 10 , active .
so , there are six of 10 .
and that 's what we 're going to do is to get the market when it 's all about one .
and hope , to try and get a future .
and what happened in the end of david <unk> , <unk> of the apollo <unk> , to the <unk> paris and a half , he said , well , at the bottom of the <unk> ,
so it 's beautiful .
so let 's make a good thing .
we just do n't find our customers .
<unk> to us , we have a great value .
there we have customer peace .
that 's not finished .
it 's <unk> , it goes .
so this is a <unk> that we need to do .
and then there 's no surprise .
there 's also a lot of material that seem to be good for good .
in any case , the situation , <unk> , a point in the 20th , so it 's not a market .
yet we do .
it 's a icon of the region .
the <unk> have the power to make it .
they just ask the question : `` what are we going to do ?
how much money we do in the military ?
what do we do for this ?
so what about the form of this system ?
and i personally , you have to ask me to make a lot of my job , i 'm standing in my fellow <unk> , where where i 'm trying to do , i 'm talking about the <unk> <unk> , where i 'm trying to do a lot of dead , i 'm going to talk to me about it .
i was also working on the last few years ago when i was commissioned to be <unk> at the island of iceland , and so all of the <unk> <unk> saw me that i was seeing .
and in fact , there were a <unk> of the way that were used in their money , and they knew what they were to do with almost .
so you 've got me to do this .
and i 've spent three years old as a <unk> , and now i 'm going to use this in my hope to create a long future in l.a .
zero , is it ? monday seconds , i 'm done .
<unk> .
yeah , thank you very much .
this is my three points that i want to talk to the <unk> .
why are we alone in the rewards or in business ?
how do we get to the clusters ?
and mostly what ?
what is it happening ?
let 's start with our first point .
the first part is perhaps a little bit more .
but it 's also about changing the challenges .
a few years ago , this has been a long time ago .
now we have a problem today .
now we have problems .
but it 's always for us to think that 's the population of growth .
all kinds of <unk> are <unk> .
now , if you look at a course of an eye view , your enemies is a very short note in history .
so , in the moment , we can not imagine that it 's going to be different than it 's always going on .
you know the climate crisis , the last 20 years .
some people say , well , we were looking at it , we look at the last half years .
you can look at <unk> , <unk> , you know .
you can also say who needs ?
you can also say the ocean is far .
but it turns out , if you 're looking at a little bit of it , to be the world 's important , the most important challenges that we have to do , you know , we 're just talking about the health .
<unk> means it weighs about 30 acres .
and there 's a little bit of time in our cities like mau in vienna or <unk> , and so much of them are still getting better .
but it also is about the <unk> , especially in asia .
think about the himalayas , which is the big streams , and the <unk> you 're going to go back out of the water .
it 's not about the end of the planet .
the planet is the <unk> of what we do .
and <unk> , but it 's all about us to do the people who are working in the <unk> ecosystems ,
it 's about political .
the bay rise .
the water is always less .
this is the aral sea , where a <unk> part of our <unk> .
and that 's what happens ?
this whole fantastic stuff , tell me , i 'm going to talk about , in a way , in the way , in the way , in the way , in the way , in the way , in the way , in the way , in the way , in the way , in the way ,
so , what we see is we go to the earth , what we built .
not only , the oil and the movements , and the galaxies , but also , the last time .
and we just want to look at what we 're trying to do as much as possible to get past the last time .
so it 's about this , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in the case of the case , in fact , the whole <unk> is really dramatic .
this is the challenge , not just climate change , not only c c , <unk> of a car in a different place .
more dialogue .
our technology completely changed .
now , if we even have a look at the u.n. and profits , and there 's still in the world , and in the case , in a pile of carbon footprint in the year .
in a <unk> , it was in the longest time of human history .
today , it 's 6 to <unk> .
and so it turns out of this <unk> .
and it 's very , very <unk> <unk> on earth .
it 's more in north america , even more than for the earth .
and in other parts of the world , look at africa , very much less .
and what we 're looking for us is that the implications of us , the rain , the air is much more likely in the past decades , but it 's basically what we have done in other parts of the world .
and the other parts of the world are still less .
and so the traditions that we see , <unk> , afghanistan , where you look at the look at the heart of the <unk> , and then you see where the materials come from .
and this is there , and there 's particularly <unk> , which is , there 's a lot of materials there , where the <unk> of the world .
so if we want to celebrate ourselves , we have to start with the subject .
so we have to change the world boundaries everywhere . all of us are everywhere .
and this is what we have here in <unk> life is not <unk> .
this has been called `` gandhi , '' he said that the world has enough for teachers .
and there we are , as we can see here in the average life .
this .
that was the sort of <unk> part .
but i always always think you need to change it .
even if i was trying to say , it 's also like a different way to work differently .
but , of course , you know , it 's always about the <unk> <unk> , but you have a sentence , tell me .
so , what is the landscape ?
and what we have to do is that we have in the rich , in fact , there are so many , deep , social activity , in terms of quality , in terms of life , we do n't know .
there 's a very good finger , but there are people , and you know , people who are n't so good .
i 've ever heard .
<unk> and climate change .
we work too much .
this is on the side of us , in austria , and eventually it 's too much .
i work as well .
and on the other side , we 're going to do this <unk> .
so what is a good life ?
how can we define that ?
now , this is a little scientific <unk> .
so , what i 've been talking about , and what i 'm going to say , i 'm going to say , i 'm going to say , i 'm going to say , i 'm going to talk about this , what can i say , how can i have the same time ?
and there 's important to understand quality of people in china .
education is the one of the great conditions for me .
do i have a roof above the head ?
do i have friends ?
am i going to work with life ?
but also , how do i work for me , how do i stand ?
i 'm going to call it the <unk> quality .
and then i 'm going to use two principles that are important .
that one needs needs .
the blind are the fundamental dimension of our human evolution , which is where we are .
if we can trust our needs , we are happy .
and the choice , you ca n't have to be rich or not sustainable .
you ca n't have to buy any <unk> .
what are human ?
and if you can take a bunch of scientists , i 've only two <unk> .
and there you are the physical needs , but also a need for security , for social relationships .
<unk> to charity , for <unk> , for <unk> , for freedom .
all of it has done a lot of money .
but there 's not a big part of this , but the question is , how can i read this in my life .
and that 's why i 'm talking about the second .
the norm .
so the strategy that i use to do is to get these choices .
and there it is , and that 's what i 'm going to do with a high <unk> or a half <unk> .
so , i can make a lot of money or more money .
models are just my behavior like me .
this has to do in my values , with the resources , with the possibilities i have .
so when i have a lot of money , i 'm trying to try to have to have my own thoughts , as if i want to spend a lot of money .
it 's actually about the <unk> , this is the roof over the head , and then it goes to the <unk> .
and here it 's going to be able to be able to do with a lot of them , or a lot of <unk> , that can be more or <unk> .
and if we do all the strategies that we have to do for my needs , i 'll talk about one of the research .
this .
this was the same science project .
and now what can we do now ?
how do you do it ?
and there 's just some evidence .
of course , in the same , every single person can find itself .
but the evidence on the individual kind of technical , here , i think that one of me , i have a lot of technology , and then in the political way .
what can we do ?
what can we do ?
what do we do ?
so where are we going to go ?
the slides in the beginning of the beginning , the danger is that we are going to save more affordable .
over the course of the quality of the oil , again , as the effects are getting worse , as well as soon as we come back to the next time .
or , if we can do it , in a different way , able to create a lot of <unk> , maybe it 's less <unk> with a higher quality .
there 's one of my favorite principles , maybe maybe some of the things i 'm going to be <unk> from this topic , so more quality of them is less <unk> .
so , there 's a lot of technology as a lot of the things that we can use the computer , the orange , the wave of the car , the wholeness , how can i do that ?
so , i can make a different way , i can take the house of wood , etc. .
to make a lot of <unk> <unk> or the same quality .
so my other teachers , <unk> <unk> , so that 's what it was like , the <unk> per <unk> , and there are the last thing to me , because it 's about to make a look at it .
where are the need ?
what can i do with freedom ?
and how can i do with that little bit ?
and it 's not just a little bit less , or <unk> , <unk> percent .
there are many examples that they can .
it 's called a tower in a tower , compared to six hours .
with seven <unk> , it was built .
that 's basically <unk> .
so , if you can not be able to do that , you know , if you 're not going to be able to do that , you know , if you 're not trying to add more and more and more and more and more , you know , in the same time , you know , in the same time , you know , for a lot of resources , you know , for the same amount of money , you know , at least in the moment , the whole half of the house is for the long time .
it 's also many things in our own , a way , how do we do ?
there 's a beautiful book called <unk> .
where he shows how hard it is to look at the last time of this hole .
the <unk> , i want to leave you to take the other hand , and then i 'm going to go back in this room .
now , you 've seen the same thing that i did quickly , and i read the new .
in the most <unk> , i 'm hearing the <unk> , which knows you .
when i got my facility , a few years ago , we 've sent letters .
then you can wait for the letter back to the car , i 'm going to say , `` rare is <unk> . ''
this is what i got hundreds of packing .
and i can make a lot more .
that 's productivity , which is economic growth , and we 'll look at it .
but i did n't really have time .
i 've done for me personally .
but there 's good news , slow food on me , where i really look at the hackers of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality .
and with a very <unk> <unk> quality of life .
one of my favorites is <unk> .
there 's a moment where we 've been talking about , which is that the average average person in germany , when they were talking about 10 years ago .
you can start .
who came up two years three years ago , religious books had been doing .
we have the algorithms .
we have to do it with it .
and again , people are trying to do with all of these different possibilities .
and a lot of babies that allow us to help us with these little things .
in fact , i do n't know what i 'm talking about is whether it 's a better call from the <unk> there , that 's what i do n't do n't .
and the next example is to be able to do .
a real <unk> .
in fact , <unk> , <unk> , could be used to be a few years ago .
in the meantime , people are more likely when they think about cancer .
if you think about loyalty .
so , one of these two ways to work with this , how can you have the things that we 've been doing this beautiful <unk> , which has been a few hundred years ago , and just start to learn about the other centuries of it .
and this is what it was going to be better .
that 's the final asking for justice .
and i 've been showing you to see how unilever is that they call it as a picture between africa and europe .
so , in the same time , all of these resources , we can only be able to create less .
and that does n't mean less quality , because many of us have a lot of work for a lot .
but it 's a important problem of economics , the company , these products , these services , we spend a good relationship with a lot less resources .
in fact , this is what i 've got to do with the great world of economic growth in the growth , i 'm doing it .
now , if you read a little bit about the plate , this is going to happen by <unk> , <unk> , now , the <unk> of every week , this led back to the bottom .
it 's , yes , a crisis in front of the door to my view , and also , what we 've done a lot of economists , and you 're looking for all of these countries , and you can see the <unk> for all the cultures .
and there is no reason to natural growth , such as i spent from my youth , from the <unk> years .
for part of this has been a science project .
one of five percent growth rate is so much like eight percent growth rate .
and then eight percent is what china is today .
they were about it , where we were faced with breast cancer .
in fact , when the apple is bigger , of course , it 's higher than eight percent .
the one percent is still a lot of us , we 'll be good .
but you have to find out about it , if you had no percent growth in the next year , and so many times and incomes and incomes .
we can do better , and we can work .
and this is not so mad , because you know , i mean , you know , i mean , you know , i mean , you know , you know , i mean , you know , you know , you know , that you know , that you know , that you know , that you know , that you know , in fact , we 're unaware of these statistics
the economy grows , but the quality of people in the world is about in the countries that we are .
and in fact , jobs are still not just as much as it can not be so much like us , and as you can see all of them .
it 's not easy , and then you have to start with the economy .
and it always goes back , and it 's always going to be like <unk> or like a new week , i 'm going to go to a larger story with something like this .
in fact , david <unk> , who 's <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> that he said that good life expectancy , the great cultural <unk> <unk> .
that 's why , at least , at least , at least , and not about 40 years , not just about growth of economic growth .
for <unk> , and these countries , also for china , for india , for india .
and that 's going to happen to the same as if we are growing up , and we 're just going to work on this level , on this high level , where we are good at the age of life .
and it 's also worth politics .
it 's goals .
it needs to say , the economists .
it does n't only have the growth of the growth , but we really want to look at the quality of the world , right ?
is this one ?
and so our politicians are .
of course , how high is the <unk> ?
so how does this look like ?
we need a really important aspect to the <unk> and even at work .
now , who are interested in them with autism , but also , all the very good .
so what we 're trying to do with how to hustle , we know , for a few days .
you could do it differently .
the resources are more important , and so they are the resources that are not working .
and you need to do at the same time you 've all experienced to create a lot of help to create <unk> , health , infrastructure without infrastructure .
this is , but you have to look at a little bit .
this is , of course , more , less , less or less , in all of the benefits , we can think of ourselves , as we can do , how do we need to do , how do we need to do , how do we need to do , how do we need to do , how do we need to do , how do we need to do , how do we need to do .
what do we need , and what do we need ?
and the right technologies get to come up .
a couple of evidence .
and last summer , of course , science percent of all the things are still in the direction , how do we create the growth ?
unfortunately , unfortunately , it 's not possible .
if you look at the sound if you look at the last 20 years , it 's still going to the bottom of the time .
the politics is not , and the consequences will not be growth , but it 's the question of what we 're talking about , and is that we have a good life ?
so , <unk> it .
this is the <unk> of the <unk> .
so for the heart , computers , hand , and then , the next time we need to do .
thank you very much .
i 'm <unk> <unk> .
and i love these city .
this city has so many stories to tell .
one has been a few hundred years ago .
and it leads to creative .
and i think of this creative method i go , and i think of my story .
she 's going to do with the <unk> .
this is smart <unk> , which is here in the middle of this city , a lot of these city and uncertainty .
another story .
it was in a hot summer in <unk> , nevada .
a man , like , at his shoes , in the morning , in the morning , in fact , in the morning , in the morning , in the morning .
it 's too high .
he 's rude , he does n't like that .
and he 's looking at a <unk> , and he 's not going to be a prisoner of tylenol , and it 's a lot of holes there are many holes in there .
he <unk> the lagos up his head , and it takes a new yorker in orbit .
it 's the shoe that mike , born .
and this number that you see here is the <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
a company is <unk> , for four letters .
the one or another of you .
he designed the original idea , and it 's called <unk> .
both of them .
so , he says , `` well , <unk> , i 'll give my own company .
he 's going to the <unk> .
right now , hundreds of thousands of employees in the world 's reduced high school in the world 's population in the world .
so a lot of a creative option .
why not a new degree , which is n't it ?
and the games have been asking the question that leads to <unk> .
if you do n't know , if you do n't know , it 's for what is the opportunity ?
this question is actually taught me in order to learn .
if a lot of work , or my graduate students urged me or technology does n't work or whatever .
<unk> , little memory , <unk> .
what is this a opportunity ?
and here 's what you 're talking about is <unk> .
so what the implications can i do with this is here .
and another example was <unk> by the <unk> massacre , and that 's <unk> <unk> .
and the idea of how creative beings can be when it 's about their own desire .
i want to show you some examples here .
so , that 's actually done so much in the <unk> tablets , and that 's made a fax machine .
i <unk> the math .
my son did n't have the wife .
he 's just <unk> , it 's the wife by the <unk> .
or i was able to put up all the day , and as a matter , i got a <unk> in my opinion , and i could n't see the other car .
well , who 's it , right ?
the bush .
the <unk> are <unk> .
i grew up and i had two times almost .
so , you know , you know , at the time , i 've been looking at half the <unk> .
the last thing i did was not the crash .
it was a young woman in the <unk> .
if you are a man , every other explanation .
if you 're a woman , you do n't know it .
so people are creative , we are creative .
and i think , and i think we teach teachers that we use all of these creativity .
many of us are in a <unk> <unk> .
and that does n't have to be like that .
why does n't just think differently ?
google things that we 've been able to do is that we 've got to <unk> it , that we may be <unk> or <unk> .
now , as you do n't just do it , the <unk> , as a simple simple <unk> .
and there are so many companies that we use .
so , for example , for example , they have these <unk> of their traps , and they can look at the wall , for example .
so , a way , right ?
it 's like a coffee plan instead of doing this .
or so .
we do n't have a <unk> , <unk> them .
it 's now <unk> , right ?
if you ca n't make your cell phones .
or eat up to me , otherwise .
<unk> , sadly , depressingly .
this is something .
i 'm talking about one of the clients , and if you look like , and say , okay .
the <unk> .
it 's a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> , and it 's in <unk> .
and again , in the middle of the least news , again .
if you were three times of the e.u. , you 're <unk> .
and they were looking for a long time to eat .
it 's a <unk> building , and the restaurant , very small , so the strength had all of their hands .
it was too busy .
they 've been talking about , together , what do we do ?
how do we solve the problem ?
we can not go faster in the kitchen .
this idea is taken .
on every table , a <unk> <unk> <unk> water releases <unk> and pepper and a <unk> .
that 's how the yankees were able to eat their shoes for itself .
just <unk> .
a creative idea , and maybe even <unk> .
there 's a person that 's not going on .
and so the person is the <unk> of the <unk> , so the <unk> of the <unk> .
and in fact , the early union is the middle .
so the second day , this is still going on , so four days .
a company has been <unk> for the federal government of the month , and they may be like that .
an <unk> says , `` i 'm not going to tell you .
people are going to go back to the <unk> .
the servers are full , it 's going to be <unk> , people are able to work together , all of the other people think about a piece of meditation .
but why are n't going to be able to use a lot of handling and creative lives ?
sometimes it mostly creativity .
and it comes out of a <unk> , like this company you might know .
so what we 've done is that it 's not really hard to do with the <unk> , but you have to be able to do the problem of what we need to do .
or at the <unk> in the car .
we know the different ones , <unk> , all of all angles .
yes .
why does n't have a piece of lentils to the car when you 're <unk> ?
or in <unk> , there are also to create the creative .
and all of this has to do with humor , with joy , well , is it inevitable ?
sometimes it 's funny .
finally , my <unk> son in my office .
and there 's this piece of <unk> .
so , we have a bunch of <unk> around the <unk> .
and then it 's from the left to the right , he 's joy , and i 'm going to tell you to say , you know , that 's not a playground .
he 's looking for me , look at the same eyes , beautiful .
and in the moment , i 'm all right now , right ?
why is n't that a twist ?
why is this , what do we do n't care ?
so this is a lot of fat , right ?
if we 're curious , if we use our talents , what we want to do .
and it 's associated with <unk> , but very playful .
so the classic brain is , as if we spend another day , what 's going on in our brain .
it 's the first day in the week , and it 's our focus on a different day .
so one other day , we have to do that .
this is how to the weekend .
that 's what you 're looking at in the media .
in the <unk> , it 's only a day to the weekend .
or if the most exciting time of the year , it will end up .
so what are the rest of the last month ?
is it so awful ?
have we all made that awful jobs ?
a <unk> hit it , at the top , had this topic .
yes , i 'm going to take the rest of your life .
or in <unk> , on facebook , facebook , everywhere in the social networks .
and i was <unk> by the <unk> , a <unk> .
there 's a lot of a lot of kids , and i 'll look at it .
so what are the inside of the <unk> , what are there ?
and one day i used to buy this store with this test .
and the first signs that you see here , it 's really nice .
so , from working with love to work .
i 'm going to do this . dad is five of five kids , but i love my work .
yes .
or even <unk> for <unk> is the <unk> sign .
why is your own attitude , and it 's always getting increasingly , and it 's always going .
someone has an answer to this direction , and it 's not the dish .
and i wonder , in fact , i 'm going to ask with the pink apps here , and i 'm going to ask , okay , please ask .
what on my job is beautiful ?
it 's like , `` if it 's the pink finger , it looks all over time .
so , a good job , it does n't seem beautiful .
the pink bow is from great to the beach .
it 's going to be a wonderful place where you could get in the eye .
but they do n't use them .
where will we do that ?
in fact , the job , the content , our <unk> ?
within the company , outside of the <unk> .
it may be in a system where we feel like the mouse .
the mouse is going to be in this wheel , and it 's going on , and that 's going to go , quickly , the wheel , and it arises .
what is the mouse ?
you do n't know anything else , it 's coming back in the <unk> .
and again , again , again , again , again , again , at the movie , you 've got to look at the movie , you know , you know , you know , you know .
this is beautiful <unk> over here , and she does it again .
and what we know is that , how do you feel like your mouse , or yes ?
or something good , it 's <unk> .
i was working on a lot of years ago , until i was working on a meal home .
and again , the streets of me , was the black hole in my eye and somehow ,
in the next day , i went to the doctor , because i thought , what was there ?
he looked at me , and he said , `` well , it 's useful all .
but how does it look like ?
and i watched in my calendar to see that , and i saw three weeks , and i was working on the job .
after 20 years in the <unk> , and the questions that we can see in the early days , if we could do it .
i thought , well , what about life ?
and finally , <unk> , back to other people , i think , with my family <unk> , something good for me .
<unk> <unk> , if you do n't have a different musical environment in my job , a new set .
i 've been trying to take a little bit of religious groups that make me feel joy .
i 'm going to talk about how to stop and post-docs , and other other things , but i want to tell you the same time , all sorts of toys .
and that 's not always that .
now , i 've learned to make sure that oxytocin is inevitable fake .
and sometimes it 's really much easier to the mast , the <unk> , for me , it 's been very close to the hospital that he had a heart attack , and at the time , it starts to be <unk> .
so when i said , you take a conversation with you , he 's always <unk> , yes , you know .
today it goes .
so this is a <unk> , beautiful slowly , right now , in the right northeast , but eventually we 're going to do in unison .
what happens ?
in stage , we will all healthier .
the <unk> move down , but a curve , the <unk> , the lack of mental health .
<unk> of four percent of the last 10 years , thousands of millions of years , it 's beautiful , it 's less .
china 's second fossil weapons are overweight .
that 's something i think is to be that ?
why is that ?
is it just in hamburg ?
no , but in germany , it 's like that .
<unk> , <unk> , that 's all about .
this is just shown here in the left .
there 's almost five hundred percent of the last 10 years , a <unk> german <unk> .
the number of <unk> <unk> .
all of the cost .
and there 's all kinds of anthropologists , what can we do with this topic ?
now , for example , if you 're trying to do this , you 're going to have a <unk> , like , for example .
so it 's good .
and somebody said , no alcohol is not a solution .
but what is the solution ?
what is we doing , what do we need to do with it and <unk> and weirdoes ?
and that 's what i 've been looking at the last 20 years .
i 've been thinking about , how many people can get in this way ?
i 'm <unk> , and the job is not what we 're going to do , and you want to be happy .
there are many other things that are important , family , health , faith and so on .
but , of course , we 've seen the largest part of our <unk> in work .
and if we do that , we do n't like that , but it does n't feel good for us .
the <unk> <unk> i 'm telling you , and i 'm trying to <unk> and <unk> it .
so this little chirp , which is trying to make sure .
it 's <unk> for the freedom of freedom .
this is , how do i call my demand ?
so , what about the environments i do ?
what freedom is i doing this , what i want to do ?
because it 's the bottom of the <unk> that we have <unk> .
the more likely to be more stress .
and what do i do ?
it 's gorgeous .
and these are areas of these four areas .
and it can all of it for itself .
i had to look for myself a few years ago , and i 'm going to make it all the time .
can i use my identity ?
what is the environment ?
and this is sometimes , i go into a cafe with my laptop to try to steal my jewelry or a <unk> .
the freedom .
and the freedom that i can do is to do what 's important .
and do i do it ?
it 's gorgeous .
the last <unk> .
and then you 've always come back and say that i 'm not doing this .
and why this is a little harder .
and so , in fact , i 've got to look at all the answer .
who wants to explore .
who wo n't have .
and in the way , you can be able to make a <unk> of me , do i have a problem , or do i know ?
and they are in both right .
so what do we do with our relations ?
each of them made his great <unk> .
it 's much too small .
it 's filled with interactions , with gold , with places , with their skills .
what do we do ?
for the end , we ask ourselves .
or when we are in the hospital , or at the end of a lifetime .
what did i do with my job ?
by the way , who 's really focused on <unk> <unk> , and they want to stand together .
so , what do we do with our robot , is my first question , even at all day .
<unk> i 'm doing so good enough ?
and resources .
there was a story with a story .
i 'd like to talk about <unk> .
and the <unk> i 'm doing is to do .
and this was the <unk> for the <unk> as a half years ago .
and the signs seemed that this logo was so good that you could n't make them .
<unk> walls of ways of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
it was <unk> .
so the idea that look , okay , if we did n't like , then we form a <unk> .
we do n't throw out there .
let 's look at the same time .
the <unk> were going to wait for long to the day where the <unk> were almost .
and you 've only had a chance that was already on the way to go back , and as soon as the prophet said to me , the beatles gave me the <unk> and took my three days .
and okay , <unk> , you have you , you know , you have to tell you , i 'm going to tell you , i 'm going to take out of the <unk> , and keep us .
it 's called the <unk> path .
so again , the enemies are like the wall of the samara is a <unk> , and it goes back to the left right now .
well , think that , a <unk> , which is that .
it 's dead .
again , a <unk> <unk> , at the wall of the christ , this is , it 's a black number .
and think of the thinking , oh , this has two glories , you can do something .
so at the moment , the same thing is , again , is that it 's the <unk> , which is there .
at the end of the second day , after the six different legends , they went to a <unk> .
because , in fact , they thought that we go to long , we do n't care about it .
and then finally , the <unk> went down to the <unk> and the <unk> .
and one of them , they gave them .
these are <unk> <unk> .
i want to understand that thought that everything is that we need , and we have everything .
sometimes it 's energy resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's less .
but also , we can do something .
we have no idea of power that we have invented the world for a daily basis .
and if you think it might be a good samaritan , you can be right .
in the spring , the spring goes .
it 's coming .
and we 're going to <unk> you , at the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the air is there , it 's going to be the plants that we 're going to be able to get the plants to be <unk> by green meters .
this is where you 're looking at these <unk> structures .
there 's a lot of training that we can harvest and eat .
there 's going to be the forest that we can get rid of that tissue , and we can get harassed .
there are all animals animals .
there are people who inject them products .
and it 's automatically .
now , if you think about that , you do n't like all of these things , it 's a fear and <unk> .
and of course , this size is just very rare , and also , but it 's just a part of the <unk> , the link of the plant , and it 's very , very large .
now , there are experiments that show us to be 75 percent of our food , particularly food that we are not detected .
and then the sound like this is because it 's as normal for us , and we ca n't know that .
now , there were a very interesting movie , <unk> , for the subject .
and i 'm going to show you , look at it .
now what we 're looking at is the <unk> <unk> that we 're working with bees , who 's in his business , in probabilistic , the importance of bees .
this is what he does here in school , and he will tell us about a work .
please , mr. <unk> .
yeah , good evening .
a little bit , for example , a friend , for peter <unk> , and at the whole <unk> .
so i 'm here with my project , however , <unk> <unk> , i think , that 's the cure for bees .
and so , in fact , a part of a <unk> , a little bit about a little bit of fun to do it .
so what i 'm trying to do is that the most important thing that you 've been working on today is that there 's a <unk> company in <unk> minutes in the genesis of the <unk> .
i wo n't do it .
but maybe you want to convince you , they 're trying to try to take these <unk> , or you get some kind of empathy that you 're trying to do with you , i 'm going to do with the <unk> of <unk> .
my name is thomas <unk> , i 'm <unk> years old , father of five kids do n't have access to five kids , or most of the kids of my kids , i 've been working with <unk> photos in the <unk> and <unk> .
i 'm a <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , and i 'm <unk> for the <unk> .
and work now in the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of our lab with our oldest students .
we work in the garden , in agriculture , in the west .
<unk> is actually a little bit of <unk> <unk> , and it 's <unk> <unk> .
our <unk> classroom is a half , a smartphone , a quiet thing .
and it also continues to calm .
it 's almost a <unk> issue .
and not for a sudden , the old greeks , the owner of the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> .
and in a wonderful verse , he shows like the <unk> <unk> his <unk> to the <unk> architect to tell him that he can stop .
but the <unk> , they do n't look at it , and they send their blue bees , and now the prophet the <unk> of the lips and in the mouth in the mouth , and again , and at the time , it 's like the words of honey .
a beautiful picture .
hopefully everybody .
yes .
the eiffel classroom .
i come to the project .
one of these <unk> , which is that my students , which is my students with me , i 've been working on for 300 to <unk> days .
in fact , in <unk> schools from <unk> in the north pacific , or the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> .
it 's a <unk> for <unk> or in malawi .
the teachers , the one i 'm going to do with me in the class , and we look at a <unk> place for this .
most importantly , the kids can see something like this month .
and all of these things , the bees who are there , and then you can be able to be able to be able to throw it out of saturn .
and then it turned into a window .
this .
and then the whole thing i 'm looking at me .
so , i 'm going to take a <unk> , and i 'm going to take a <unk> of two <unk> , and i 'm looking at these <unk> .
and what 's important on this hole are <unk> .
so , of course , we 've got <unk> <unk> , and here 's got to be on the edge of the food , so , the eggs .
and then a <unk> , here .
there 's all of it .
you have the need you need to be able to find out whether you can not fly .
this .
this is what it looks like .
and then the <unk> sits going on here , and then begins again , the color in the direction of the arts in school .
and now it 's a wonderful thing .
ladies and gentlemen , and what these bees have in this class is a crisis .
their people are not more .
they are lonely .
they do n't find their queen .
and this is the most important task from the <unk> , when he does this <unk> that he is the queen of the old people .
so that 's not in the two <unk> .
and they are sad , these bees .
they begin to <unk> .
yes , the <unk> says they 're <unk> .
you hear that .
and it 's almost as a <unk> higher than when they 're going to go into their wallets with a queen .
and now , a <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , in a night , you 're now going to do a new people , and that 's all done without <unk> , <unk> , without foresight .
so here 's the people in the first night , and there 's a <unk> .
because the queen would have spent the people in six weeks .
because <unk> life only six months .
this .
and in this first night , you take a wall of a <unk> of a <unk> , and put it in that crater .
and there 's called the name of the queen .
everybody who had been <unk> in the school , would you like that .
yes , all cfo , it 's all <unk> .
that 's true .
and now it 's a wonderful thing .
and this faucet , in this case , if you were going to be able to put it in the <unk> , you would think of the queen .
the computer has opened up the first three days , as the <unk> .
and then it 's going to be <unk> by a <unk> .
you know that term .
and then , in fact , in fact , in fact , in the <unk> , the genetic code .
the <unk> are controlled by the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
we had told that before , what we were doing this , which was coming from us .
and the queen 's really really beautiful .
so , three days , video , five days .
and these can all relate to students .
that 's what they 're looking at .
and then that cell phones will be <unk> with a <unk> ghetto , and this is not all the people now do n't care about it , or to say , `` you 're going to be a <unk> saying , you do it .
no , that 's what happens .
ladies and gentlemen , that 's a <unk> or a <unk> .
and then , the students eight days of my students , three five dollars a queen , <unk> days that these little <unk> .
and at the day , if this is what 's going on , the teacher has opened up the <unk> in the wake up five times , yes .
and then the mom says , tell me , what about it ?
yes , i have to live in school .
yes , why ?
yes , our queen <unk> .
yeah ?
and then the left is about six years .
and then your <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , because they want to hear about the queen .
and if you can do that experience , you know , you know .
this is abraham .
this .
just a little bit higher .
and then the <unk> and the <unk> are the queen .
so the first thing that the internet is doing , they loved it to their wings , and now , with her <unk> of these people , their <unk> , their <unk> .
the people now have a identity .
now , three to five days ' these <unk> .
from the <unk> , you get your <unk> <unk> .
on the back of the people coming out of the people , from this diagram .
and after five days , the queen looks like this .
now , some of you think i 've been working on , i think , a <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> , smoke .
what 's different .
that 's what we do .
this is the case alone , without <unk> , without <unk> , from this <unk> place , to go from two kilometers .
now , you 've all seen in their sneakers .
in the <unk> , and it 's going to be <unk> in a balmy point of seven to 12 times , the male bees .
so in the same term , in the same term , when the man are living women , there is the queen , and the seven to 12 men .
and the whole thing is happening in a wonderful way in it .
now , the drone comes from the <unk> of the queen , and this is the queen , and this is all the seeds for the three years .
the drone is also a special experience .
if you 're ready to do with the <unk> of it , and it goes dead from the sky .
and then the queen goes back , and it starts to push eggs .
there 's always a few , two students in the class , looking at it .
they 're looking at the queen .
yes .
and then finally , the project in school , now , the <unk> will go back and the queen and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and it 's going to go back to it .
and then i go back to this stage again .
<unk> <unk> the <unk> of the land , and at the next morning , i 'm making these <unk> with the queen and these bees .
and there you see the queen .
yes .
<unk> <unk> .
and over time , 10 to 12 acres .
and then this is , these two <unk> are going to come up here .
and in a whole stick , in a full , and now , the people are large and smart .
why were bees for school ?
ladies and gentlemen .
yes .
there 's not just that it 's in the class , the students that all the time is bees , but the whole school is happening in this class in the class .
and the teacher , when he knows something , when he can do something if he can be able to be a long time to the other .
so , imagine , bees and social <unk> <unk> , we have shown where the people have made it .
a couple of months ago , in israel 's <unk> <unk> , in the age of old <unk> , in fact , i 've been able to have the bees who have found the bees .
in human culture , with bees .
or the other ones , the bees were involved in every culture .
in china , in india , in egypt , in egypt in norway in rome .
they were everywhere .
the human experiences and ladies and gentlemen .
he can be a <unk> , a <unk> , it can be a <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , the flowers or flowers or the bees , what they need ?
this is what we find out today is now in the summer of agriculture .
this is , this is a green facility for our bees .
yeah ?
he can go back to the students in the <unk> , and there is flowers and bees like the <unk> they 're looking for , and how long need the <unk> to the flowers ?
how long are they used to the individual ?
and as long as you need to go back again .
he can make science <unk> .
how do i have a <unk> ?
yes .
you know , this is , in the <unk> , the tip goes up to the top , or are <unk> off the top ?
look at the right thing .
he can be a math -- a <unk> .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can even have the <unk> <unk> on these exoskeletons .
and then he goes to the question , how did he had invented the <unk> of the nobel prize ?
because he said that the bees are able to see this .
but ladies and gentlemen , in a beehive , it 's <unk> .
it does n't look at a bee .
and most of the professor <unk> , which is a lot of years ago in the university , which is the bees that allow bees bees have a <unk> .
as a <unk> , the internet sends out of the <unk> on the <unk> , and now with the wright brothers , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , with their legs .
do you see what these bees have in school ?
it 's <unk> 's <unk> , and the kids lose their fear .
and , of course , of their fortunes for the bees .
you learn , <unk> , whatever they do .
and you can see one of these creatures that most of us in the most part of our lives .
the bees do n't even have a kilo of pounds of people .
<unk> years ago , the only possibility to fly wet .
they accumulate in the <unk> outside of the trees outside the trees .
this is a <unk> , with your <unk> .
and now , imagine , in the summer , these are <unk> -- <unk> <unk> on a game space .
hey , there 's <unk> .
no , not the bees .
because they have <unk> antibiotics .
they collect the pollen , and it turns out , they 're going to <unk> him , and it becomes a fish .
someone who 's used to the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , can not be able to go to a <unk> , and to make a <unk> improvement , by resorting to the <unk> .
of course , there 's a bone marrow , and with <unk> with a <unk> , and so forth , there 's nothing .
yes , and then my memory and gentlemen , which is that the bees are also , and we would need less inclined to do n't know if bees do n't fly , or we would have to be able to take the chinese to the <unk> , and they all <unk> .
there are many more options .
if you look at the <unk> , because of the bedrooms , the area of the <unk> , where the cows are .
and there 's where the bee works , and it 's moving on the nectar and blur this <unk> .
and now the cow and slaps the <unk> and only , because they have <unk> <unk> fish .
yeah ?
and then she <unk> the back and you can hear , ah , i 'm <unk> <unk> .
and then there 's milk .
this is the bee .
yeah ?
and finally , the crux of us can determine the feelings of what it is on nature .
it sounds .
i 'd like to go to the point where i 'm going to go back .
and my students have to each other year when they build these <unk> , and then they 're talking to me together .
now , i 'm not supposed to do that , but i was in college in college , and i was in the back in the '80s in <unk> , and she said ,
and then he says , yes , i 'm hot hot <unk> .
i come from <unk> , and i 'm a few years .
and i grew up for five years in <unk> , and i 've spent a year for two years ago .
and i 'm not talking to me that i 'm not going to learn today to learn how to do with the hands .
<unk> , yes , with your head .
and a <unk> went through the <unk> , <unk> college .
and more than the half said , oh yes , that would be .
for my students , there 's a tremendous movement and the fastest-growing link , and i 'm going to take the <unk> and <unk> people , and the people are resorting to bees .
in youngmenowme , they took them , and they get my hands , my students and a certain game .
how do you go to the bottom ?
the question is wrong .
you have to say , how do you get to the <unk> ?
and because i think i 've been there , there is also the man who know the other people , and i have a new <unk> .
and he says that , start with that .
on the end of a little piece of <unk> <unk> .
and so the way the bee would be <unk> the sun through the <unk> , and never went to the direction of the earth 's <unk> , as long as he did n't cry .
thank you very much .
hello , love friends in the world .
welcome to my desk project .
the project of my husband and my wife .
it 's the fight for a end of female female .
in my view , the biggest treaty of humankind , because it has been over for millennia .
the society for thousands of women with all ages per day .
first of my favorites .
my name is <unk> , i come from salt .
and so i went to <unk> a <unk> institute .
you can not think about my job .
i did n't feel ashamed .
and that 's why i was happy to find myself in the way that i was interested in <unk> .
for example .
with a massive <unk> over the atlantic of africa .
in fact , in a <unk> , the <unk> valley of the united states of the congo ,
this was a self-portrait where i was more <unk> than <unk> , more <unk> than <unk> .
but nevertheless , these laws was to find the interest of the media , and even a small man , as i could take the benefits world worldwide .
<unk> <unk> , i 'm <unk> the <unk> in ethiopia .
at the time , there was a <unk> and <unk> , and we were <unk> of these clouds .
and despite all of these rides , we used to be in the other side that we call the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> that we used to call `` shanghai . ''
and twice as we were asked , and our two <unk> that we see here with their bodies as a living <unk> of us , and the <unk> we call it .
if you want to kill you to meet them .
it 's not something that i found in any other culture .
and at the age of people who have learned that islam is not restricted to terrorism .
now , christians , they do n't use it in order to be in their states .
for example , the <unk> .
the <unk> , the <unk> .
you want to focus on the real values , like , as well , social responsibility .
these are the values that they are .
after many years , i was working on this <unk> , and with my wife .
and this is what we heard about this <unk> female .
so when i heard about the <unk> of the <unk> victims , the rest of christians are the <unk> and <unk> .
and the idea was that the highest budget of islam did the practice to protect .
we were looking at the age of germans organizations that we have n't found .
and so we had to say , well , we would be completely <unk> , which islam is not indestructible .
you 'd say the toothbrush .
and in fact , in fact , we 've got to <unk> our own organization .
and were <unk> and <unk> .
and to do this struggle for us , we 've got to connect images .
there was a problem .
and so , of course , <unk> , and i went back to these larvae to make these images .
the sounds terrible images that i 'm not going to show you , but i want to revenge .
now in the age of four weeks to the day , in the course of the parents , and on the parents , you get on the wall , and then you get into the iss , and i 'm going to go back to the iss , and without the <unk> , and you can buy it , and without the <unk> , and you can buy it , and without the <unk> , and without <unk> instruments , or the <unk> ,
what you 're looking at is a lump of size .
now it 's going to be an hour .
if you get your mouth , you get two weeks .
<unk> dudamel and soul .
this was the beginning of the so-called <unk> .
in the <unk> , you go .
the man 's got to open it .
he never saw a <unk> woman .
the <unk> man said that , steven , is n't a problem .
you <unk> your trunk with <unk> , and then you go .
and if you do n't , it 's not bad .
and you take the knife and <unk> them .
this is <unk> <unk> .
and she 's a third of the girl .
this had a few months ago .
the ipod has lost his language .
these are the <unk> , some of them in asia .
most people are born .
and when we were scared , why did you do that ?
and the <unk> answer , we have to do , that 's in the koran .
nothing in the koran is about the opposite .
each time you spend five days every single day in the morning , like today , the tsunami , perfect , <unk> .
but they do n't seem to believe what they thought .
they <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> of women who are wrong wrong , and why do n't think about how human life expectancy is about women .
but now we had the images of the first <unk> .
he <unk> us , his whole <unk> <unk> <unk> .
there were plenty of two , two days .
but we had the <unk> on our side , the highest flow of our side .
and then the great decision , the secret is to all the human race , for religion , we need it .
and the last thing is that the cost of this new <unk> .
and if you look at africa , and you know , you know , that 's why , you know , you 've got for these people .
and it was born , and we were also known in other countries .
so , for example , ted <unk> <unk> us from the highest proportions , the <unk> of the country , the message of the land , the <unk> of the land , the <unk> of the land , that it 's a crime , and that 's now in the <unk> .
we were at the same time with the <unk> .
we had a hundred thousand <unk> .
and where we 've done , we 've only open eggs , open arms and the historic , lyndon <unk> .
and when we wanted to read the country , were the great henry and <unk> <unk> , would you think about all of the countries ?
there 's a lot of life that you do n't want to do .
he 's right .
i 'm <unk> , and there is to be able to be done .
and suddenly , he had a idea .
he said , if it 's going to take the ten man muslims in the world to get the table to the table , and the idea of the software , it 's a sin .
<unk> and i went to <unk> in the <unk> , and -- like the <unk> of the <unk> .
and in fact , for example , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> professor , <unk> , we got a <unk> .
he heard the idea of it before , especially when we <unk> him that we would call it .
and that 's what we 're talking about manure to help us .
and then , he said , i 'm not just going to tell you the conference , so as we had to do it , but i 'll get the <unk> .
and that 's what he did .
at least , <unk> , at least , at least , at least , at least , <unk> our <unk> .
<unk> <unk> at the <unk> of the female body .
you know , in the <unk> of a professor called <unk> <unk> .
and everybody 's got them .
hundreds of <unk> , but the highest part of the world .
in the middle of the <unk> , a man , <unk> in moscow and in the rest of europe , he 's the <unk> of the arts .
so men can read and live .
but the other hand .
on the top of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of my <unk> .
the highest of the world .
so , i think , i know , i think only about a neurosurgeon , and i 'm exercising a lot of time .
and then i did it all .
it started the conference .
and through our sign on the bottom of the left edge of egypt .
the <unk> <unk> of the east coast , <unk> , from a friend and <unk> <unk> , germany .
so much for the topic , islam is not indestructible .
we had redwood-like technologies that are used in their way , which was why they were women doing things that we had .
and then put your movie , <unk> .
of course .
so the men had <unk> eyes .
and she went back behind los zetas , and only two hours , you had decided and bought a <unk> .
the <unk> of the cameras , the cameras , what you 've been doing .
and the most exciting sentence in that , that was this .
the novelist of nepal is a <unk> of the <unk> of islam .
he <unk> the <unk> .
we thought the job was done , but we did n't want to make our <unk> .
because the shame , talking about the wife of my wife is more than anyone .
that 's what we 've got to do .
we have this conference called the knee of this called the book .
a <unk> for the <unk> of this world .
and because henry <unk> , the <unk> , it was so good , the book , he was able to be <unk> .
it 's going to happen to the hope .
we were in the world , in many countries , we went to a lot of people .
and they realized that with many of these were so excited that they had the book <unk> .
but unfortunately , most of the courage is not the courage to do .
you know , for the wheels of the woman , you can talk to the <unk> .
only some people have the courage .
they were working in the universities ,
and sometimes we have a little <unk> <unk> that we have found ourselves in the 1930s , like this .
and then it goes across the <unk> .
and that 's the people .
it will spread .
but this is my time .
it 's all around a hot salt , and i 'm working on many other airplanes , which is even <unk> .
it 's a practice .
but my <unk> would be like this .
i want to be the great message of the highest <unk> of the world 's <unk> of islam , in the <unk> .
not in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , but in the <unk> .
if there are four million people together , men and women are 700 women .
and then i <unk> with all of these things , and the <unk> king , and then the <unk> king my <unk> .
now , as i 've been doing this morning , in the <unk> .
unfortunately , i was the last <unk> , that would be the <unk> king .
but i 'm sure if he was going to leave you with them .
for a lot of these women .
for other people around the world , which is the real values of islam , instead ,
for terrorists as followers .
now , if i do n't , i do n't have that , then , i would like this to find out in malawi .
there 's a lot of <unk> in the world in the world .
and we could use the benefits .
and maybe i just want to tell you that the little girl does not shove his daughters .
then my life is so busy .
and i want to look at every single person who 's going to talk about that , or the question .
it 's not at least not a <unk> .
we have to take the <unk> to the <unk> , otherwise , i do n't get here .
and now i want to leave you with the design of my favorites .
this is my <unk> , my <unk> .
and this is in all walks of arabic is the <unk> <unk> , and it 's got to show you .
on the bottom , we 've got it in latin america .
the novelist of female language is based on the koran and the mastery of islam .
it 's <unk> and a <unk> of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i 'll go to this .
this is how the <unk> were out of looking for germany in germany .
on the <unk> , my mother 's sister , my brother and i 've been so a <unk> .
it was <unk> .
my mom was completely upset because it did n't have us all the time .
on the third day , we had failed .
and so we were able to take the stuff back to it , and a <unk> woman , and that 's just <unk> .
they tried to explain us , they loved food .
this is not uncommon .
it feels very good .
it 's magic .
my mom took the <unk> and we cried .
wow .
i mean , in my own business , we have n't been able to paint the <unk> .
i 'm <unk> <unk> and <unk> years old .
fourteen years ago , i went to my mom and my brother of china to germany .
and that 's why i 'm talking about this <unk> .
but most importantly , that 's what i 've been able to do is that the people who have created this pin and have a success story .
but first , i tell you where i 'm talking about .
i 'm <unk> .
<unk> are a little <unk> that live in the u.s. .
and this region is controlled by the chinese budget called <unk> .
it 's about <unk> miles from germany .
in china , it 's 10 million <unk> , but in ethiopia , the largest <unk> community in china is china .
and this <unk> life , because of course , because we have to talk about china in the morning .
hundreds of millions of chinese have been used to <unk> africa that we have developed to become a minority .
our own mother , <unk> was made by the education system .
in schools , in africa , only poor people .
and our religion may not be free .
so the <unk> , they are losing their culture and identity .
and when someone 's logical means , or for the right side of the racetrack , you know , you know , if you 're older , or even death .
this is also the reason why my parents have decided to help us .
this was <unk> , and i was old years old .
and the photo is short of our train .
we did n't have a lot of money .
i <unk> a lot of people who have helped us .
i <unk> myself in many images .
but i think of myself , i 've been working on for the <unk> of the <unk> .
i <unk> him exactly when i met my eyes .
he was a great signature , and we met him with his little <unk> on a parking lot .
the first step was <unk> .
i know that many exceptions to use a fantastic picture of <unk> who are just buying drugs , and they do n't care for care .
but i 'm going to say , `` i want to call him as a <unk> , ''
because azerbaijan has been us alone .
he stood up on the airport in <unk> on a <unk> , and it has been <unk> to the last decade , if we were really sure we were in the <unk> .
and in the middle of kinshasa , we came up and i know how my mother looks like to me , i 'm talking about the airport .
do n't tell you .
until we are outside .
because i had a look at my hand , and there was my photograph , and it was a <unk> name , <unk> .
i had to be used by the <unk> .
and i 'm talking about ze <unk> that i showed him in the hand .
seven .
<unk> .
a long game .
we 've been <unk> .
in arusha , <unk> , <unk> , i was interested in many ways that we have a lot .
i 'm going to call me the <unk> of my wife , which is used to us .
in an <unk> with four <unk> per hectare per year .
in tears , children kids .
a <unk> and a kitchen .
there were dead parents .
and many different languages .
and we had no privacy .
my mom , my brother and i had to share with a <unk> .
there 's been done , done and homework .
now , i did n't have to look at home because i grew up where we grew up .
i mean , i mean , i 'm just tearing the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> .
she knew my story , and i grew up and she was talking to me .
for example , she took me to <unk> me what i do n't do .
but it helped me to eat german <unk> .
i spent my whole name in the <unk> .
that 's not for my mom .
in any of our kids without the man , and we were in the subconscious because we had just a <unk> , and we would have been able to be able to be able to be stopped .
i was talking to me that i was very , very interested in time .
it 's also very funny for me to tell you today , but now i need to tell my story .
i was very <unk> , and i was interested in school .
they showed us to our <unk> , where we first saw with normal kids .
with normal my own , i have kids who did n't have to live in .
and i also call me to the <unk> that i call me and my brother and <unk> .
just for it .
i was able to make a lot of <unk> who were told us that did n't hope for me , because our parents did n't have a war .
or the only thing we did .
we always did it .
now , i know how we were always in the trenches , and waited to these people , because they kind of thousands of thousands of time for us to do , and that 's what we have .
after two years , my father went to germany .
but the problem was , though he was supposed to <unk> on <unk> , because there were no place for him .
and i 'm talking about this very , very young woman that made it , my father in the world bank , we 've been able to make sure that he was in our own lives .
and i was looking at this time where i really was very , very good , because for six years , we were able to get into a normal store .
we got a <unk> for three years , and we had a computer store with one of them , and a lot of them .
and i was even hospital .
it was very little , and i had no office in a while , but it was good .
and i <unk> that time , very well , but i had to be able to get the <unk> .
i did n't really know what i was not .
there was a <unk> that made me in the <unk> , and it was still in the idea that i was talking about the second <unk> of my sculptures .
first of the <unk> , the <unk> .
i look at the teacher who really understood me to me , and i 'm really not just the time i 've been trying to do it .
and then i went to the <unk> .
and before i got to college , i was going to talk to my best friend <unk> .
<unk> is an organization or a project of organized crime .
but i did n't have a lot of <unk> that i did , because we were able to take a place where we had .
we had a library of what we could call our <unk> .
and the mayor of <unk> , we 've been able to tell our problems , and he was going to help us all of our questions .
and then i went to the <unk> , <unk> .
and this is a project where a young people do n't have a chance to make a lot of interest in the way .
and this has been very good for me , and i 've realized , art is something about me .
through <unk> and our friends , a <unk> came to us .
he made the movie <unk> about my friends and me .
and the movie won a lot of awards .
we realized that our people are interested in our history .
he was a very special sense , because we did n't have people who were told us .
and this was like a moment where i thought .
i do n't want to stand .
i want to make a lot of my life .
a <unk> of <unk> , a <unk> movement of seattle , to me , to the <unk> of the train .
but , i went back to the <unk> building , and i went to a <unk> store for a canvas and the title of <unk> .
so i was right .
i go .
and the great news is that , after a <unk> two friend of <unk> <unk> from the <unk> .
and my sister asked me if i was working interested in order to get rid of the things .
i thought , great , <unk> .
i 'm sorry .
and i used for the <unk> <unk> , now <unk> <unk> , and one of my own over time to play on a canvas , i used to be <unk> for the european union .
and i did it actually .
now i started working on the park for <unk> and film of <unk> <unk> in the third year ,
and that would not be done for me , if not in both or organizations like <unk> or projects like <unk> or hope for me .
they 've been told me , and then you 've got me to create networks , you 've welcomed me , as i can see my place in society .
and i 'm going to tell you now .
each of you have the opportunity to help people like me to second , and they have your life or your place in your society .
because the people , when you come from a hundred yards of malaria , and every one of them have full of hope and every one of you have a lot of potential .
they 've done it with great utopias , behind behind .
and with this examination , you could really be a lot of clothing for germany , and for everyone else .
and i could really make a lot of things about what you can do , but i do n't have a lot of time , because i 'm talking to you ,
so , you can hear your mobile phone , you can not tell me that they ca n't be a code .
so , you can use the code , and then you can look at the side of <unk> , and you can learn how they can learn .
and that would help us happen .
now , i 've been working for you , and i 'm going to come back to me .
and put them the code .
i just miss it .
there are no leaders in your hand .
can you feel like that , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
<unk> , yes .
just wait for a <unk> attack .
let me tell you .
my name is uldus .
so my favorite language is a little bit easier than it talks about .
i 'm going to go back to me , this is in venice .
i 'm also not myself today to be today , in a <unk> , is pretty beautiful .
so i 'm going to do with a few of them .
and this is not a surprise , it 's a feeling .
yes , in fact , in the other <unk> , i 'm not today to tell you about anything .
i did n't know .
and it 's like i 'm going to show you in my walk , and then this piece of talk about , <unk> , or <unk> , or about <unk> <unk> ,
yes , and i was asked to do a couple of a <unk> , which is the whole program a little bit .
and that 's what i 'm talking about .
yes .
let me start with a joke .
they have two meals .
so , you see , in fact , two english narrator , you know , and i do n't know , '' and it 's kind of like me , i 'm not trying to get me and <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
and the other thing !
i 've always heard anything like that .
this is what we would have invented .
the first text is a little <unk> that i 've ever mentioned .
i 've been talking about a person who taught me .
it 's called the title .
and yes , she did n't understand it .
when your head was in my lap , it 's the rest of my ceiling .
my leg was also under my ceiling her leg .
my leg went for through the ceiling .
it 's going to her head , i 'm looking at my lap , the rest of you , my leg on the ceiling , the leg outside of the ceiling .
this is <unk> , as a <unk> , for example .
it was very embarrassing .
the next thing i 've ever attempted for a person who has been a lot of me .
and this is my <unk> .
we 've got to have a few more .
my <unk> grandfather was inspired by a young woman .
now , as a kid , he 's <unk> <unk> .
come on me .
yes , let 's take a little bit .
do n't better .
daddy 's the only feminist he 's on the bottom of the hill .
but where jesus is when he was given me to the <unk> of my life ?
have a sense , right ?
did i read my ph.d ?
one day .
the next text is a little bit more .
he 's going to be a few hours .
so a writing .
please go .
it 's the beginning of a novel that i 'm talking about in the <unk> .
ah , it 's about <unk> , so the higgs boson , and the <unk> of the buddha is always getting the hair and get a little bit more .
i 'm going to tell myself , but i 'm talking about this kind of <unk> myself .
because i never heard the hair .
chapter one .
if i 'm <unk> , my head is empty .
and so , as a paper like this piece , so he tries to try to him .
yes , i 'm not .
very hard for hours .
the next text is a little <unk> .
most people understand it .
i 'm trying to learn for myself .
and that 's what i 'm looking for my finger and with my language .
i always wanted to leave you with me .
and yes , you can do things like that .
it 's called the title .
it 's a bit strange , <unk> .
it may be the <unk> <unk> that i ever did .
<unk> problems .
yes , we grew up .
that 's all of us .
we 're <unk> .
let me tell you .
but i can .
i can .
i do n't .
yes , i did n't understand it .
no idea .
yeah , yeah .
i 'll always tell you either .
the next piece of music is to do with text .
it 's sort of a little <unk> .
i did call it all the time .
very ineffective .
yes , let 's take a little bit .
it 's a small <unk> .
and that 's true of all , as i 'm always saying that they have three people say .
my crew is the title , all good things are cool .
so the <unk> pattern is also dry .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
so , you have to buy , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and then it 's got a lot better .
it 's useful .
yes , even <unk> , that 's another person .
and that 's pretty much when i 'm going to make sure that we can do so , as well as we can do so , how do we try to do all the time .
right , so that 's what makes the wind power .
the text carries the title <unk> .
yes .
power for you .
the <unk> text is just just a sentence .
i want to tell you a little <unk> .
this is a <unk> template .
<unk> is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> ?
yes , yes .
power for you .
yeah , a <unk> sentence .
this is in <unk> .
it 's a very long sentence .
i think it 's impossible to do , i 'm not trying to tell you , that 's the point .
here , another one .
this is a <unk> .
it 's the title of the letter .
this is a <unk> , and he knows it .
he 's known to me before i got it as a result .
he got me to tell me a little bit , and he would give me <unk> .
i 'm going to go back to him later .
i read him .
so as a result of all of the other days of the other days of the other day ,
with a <unk> <unk> in the face , right ?
and remember , i do n't want to take it up with myself .
and i 'm going to do it again , again , it can not have a confession for a day .
have hope , right ?
now it 's time for a little joke .
what was thomas jefferson when he did n't say ?
i read .
this .
someone reads sounds like the cow .
that 's funny .
yes , the next text i 've learned the paper .
it 's more to political .
so , i do n't just talk about things .
i read for a lot of political stuff .
and i 'm often going to ask myself where i 'm reading .
and , yes , i 'm going to do this clip here .
he 's called the title .
my dad came out of a <unk> , and my wife and i was her .
yes .
if we had the <unk> .
thank you very much .
yeah , this is what i want to do a little bit of advertising .
i can not buy a business or i can do so i 'm going to do that .
and the <unk> of my favorites is , and i 'm also pitching a <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
just like that .
and i said , `` i 'm <unk> , '' i do n't really tell you .
and , yeah .
i just want to tell you .
it 's going on in the program .
it 's more .
this is a little paper i did .
<unk> .
new york will die .
so the <unk> .
<unk> acid .
now , very funny .
i want to tell you a joke about the <unk> of my friend , but it 's just a crash .
yeah , it 's not a <unk> .
<unk> them to stop the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
yes .
thank you for listening .
you had great great .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
let me talk about a <unk> question .
why do you want to focus on yourself ?
i think everybody , who 's going to be used to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to achieve .
the answer is very clear .
we also know that the life expectancy is now is just about 25 percent of its lives .
this is , there must be a lot of the <unk> , <unk> of the effects .
why do we know so much ?
why are we talking about <unk> messages from the <unk> that we have to solve each other ?
and you remember koko for the last few years ago .
it was fat .
you thought , if you get fat from food food , we would all be <unk> .
what do you think about the <unk> of <unk> <unk> roots , and what do n't changed the americans every year 's lost .
then you say , ah , no .
but not the fat .
these are dinosaurs .
and then the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> and so forth .
so it 's always going to be a new set of <unk> <unk> through this village .
how do the entire <unk> ?
well , the reason for us to do is that we 're talking about in the <unk> of this , that we 're <unk> by <unk> <unk> of science generations .
for example , for example , for example , there is a <unk> .
you know , the <unk> you know .
<unk> discovered a lot of <unk> in a new neighborhood .
the top of the <unk> <unk> <unk> for the year .
ken <unk> was seven years old .
then then the newspaper .
or this lady here .
it 's gorgeous .
the oldest man , who has half the earth .
<unk> years old .
i know , there 's a little bit of people who are saying that you are , but you ca n't find your <unk> .
solly <unk> is actually developed .
and she did n't talk to <unk> school , but at all the time , at the time , when they were talking to the <unk> of the mouth and stop .
with <unk> , she 's died .
what does this tell us ?
not that are healthy .
and it 's telling us that this is very complicated , and we can ask , we need to be thin statistics , and we need to ask ourselves .
well , a simple simple question , and a very simple thing , which is different in different countries , women are older than men .
what is that ?
we know today .
so that 's at all the time , in terms of what is going to be male .
and there 's a simple evidence that <unk> men will be like the women .
now , every single time you can think is that this is a <unk> .
erick is a <unk> country .
but it 's still going to go better , no fear .
in fact , we need to stand up to <unk> ourselves .
sounds complicated , it 's just too much <unk> .
so , someone wants to be a little bit of marriage , and ask , what did you have to do as well as well as you were ?
ah .
the granny informant won every day 10 samples .
this is the secret of your age , right ?
so , you have 10 minutes , you ca n't have disposable people .
or , they were <unk> , and the frequency would be without the ten chain .
even very bad statistics are not always <unk> .
now , for example , for example , there are very hard to see that people who are <unk> in the middle ages , as people do n't do that .
<unk> .
it 's <unk> .
is this in the <unk> ?
no .
it 's the case that people have just been a lot of money in the pocket for all the age of mental illness .
now , if i want to be a group of <unk> , you know , and i have a bunch of millions of people as a designer , or not necessarily the same time , i 'm actually going to be a <unk> factor in diet .
and in fact , these were attempts .
now , you have to tell you , the <unk> is very <unk> , but it 's what i 'm trying to do with my enemies .
and that works for a lot of organisms .
for example , bacteria .
and you see the <unk> <unk> of bacteria .
if we get the <unk> , in the middle line , you see where we 're going to do it .
and the same thing for <unk> , <unk> , and only found only about two years ago in the united states , and it 's also known for teenagers .
that 's not about being thin .
it also works at the <unk> of the kitchen .
and this is another experiment , which was done in the united states .
what did you do ?
you have a lot of <unk> , and has a lot of the brain <unk> , a <unk> diet , and so you have so many <unk> of the day and night .
and the irony is , the puritans were thick , sick , and did not feel smart , and often <unk> .
now , you have a flashlight , <unk> <unk> , and the only way that the same amount of <unk> were just <unk> .
they have nothing to eat , they did n't eat twice .
and this is now , <unk> and healthy , and it does n't have any <unk> .
now , both of these verses were used .
both have a little meal .
it 's a sick and poor others .
what happens in this case ?
it 's going to be a process called <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
whenever they are organisms or cells , all the energy cells will go back in the cell or <unk> bacteria to make it .
that makes sense .
and this looks like this .
you can see how in the cell acts as well as well , the liquidity for the sky .
the <unk> of the <unk> are the boats , and the cell acts like energy .
it will be used by the age of land in borders .
this is the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> .
so , in order to paraphrase it is <unk> <unk> , the lives in many organisms .
and it 's probably to tell people that work works .
and we learn that they do n't use to be used to <unk> each other hand on the day with nine cents .
no .
now , you want to say , if you have hungry , you can be the <unk> light .
take her hunger like a friend .
and that makes sense of mind .
now , in <unk> , nine years of human history has human rights when he was hungry ?
right , he 's dancing .
we 're eating on the refrigerator when we have hungry .
and this is safe to biology .
now , of course , we know , and this is in the bible , in the <unk> valley of <unk> , <unk> , the intelligence is weak .
the space looks for us .
here 's a <unk> <unk> in a primate .
the three <unk> that 's okay , the food is all the time .
and that 's kind of a real <unk> .
so , we 've been told ourselves in the quest for the molecular answer of the fossil fuels , even though the nervous system .
this might be interesting for people , but you can not <unk> your <unk> .
and it could allow us to find out of the latest communities of life .
so the question is , we can ask the <unk> , the <unk> , the secret flyers .
and we have a lot of a lot of a hundred billion , about a thousand .
we 've found a picture that was called <unk> .
<unk> is a substance of all living in all sorts of organisms , but also in all organisms in the <unk> .
in the skin , it 's on the skin .
<unk> people have <unk> less <unk> in the skin .
and if we 're going to focus on human cells , for example , here you can see .
this is smart 's cell .
it 's the <unk> that we get <unk> <unk> , and we see a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of thousand of the little sliver of the little sliver of the little sliver of the little sliver of the little sliver of the
<unk> cells would look like this .
and it works in different organisms .
so for example , for example , a <unk> .
so we 've got some evidence that the gods <unk> the blood pressure .
life , the adult life .
and the answer is , you see a typical typical <unk> of a <unk> .
it 's simple <unk> .
after eight days , they all dead dead , which is about half days .
when we 're going to go to the water , we 're going to be able to put in the drinking water , and we 're going to be able to take the older and more .
we also know that human beings , who we 're talking about the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , in fact , when we 're looking at it .
and worst of the research is also realized that the life of all its <unk> through <unk> .
and it 's not just life , it 's also the most populous .
these are actually <unk> <unk> .
so here .
now you want to know all of you , where are you ?
as the name is , you know , it 's been on the rooftops , because it comes out very far .
but i can put it up , so , in a <unk> , green fluorescent <unk> gardens , and a product from <unk> <unk> , which is so <unk> <unk> , which is so much <unk> .
so , we said , if we were trying to <unk> , if we 're trying to try to make sure of the <unk> <unk> so it could help protect it ?
you know , you have to know that the common line of all the adult diseases is that during the time , in the brain activity .
and we 've done experiments .
they 're going to be , we 've been going to play the environment .
now , texture is also <unk> when they 're old .
they have more <unk> in the brain when they are old .
and the <unk> mechanisms that are responsible for data on the ground .
now , you ask , like the question , the question is the memory of collaboration ?
this is the experiment that we 've been working with autism with <unk> college .
they take a hundred minutes , and i want you to take a sense that you love .
<unk> acid .
and this is in this <unk> <unk> .
and then you take the same corals , put them in the next line , and you give you some of the things that you love to do .
we 're going to listen to the <unk> , but they 're really <unk> <unk> .
it 's the <unk> .
and then you take the same corals , you see it .
so , you go back to the speed up , you see it .
and if you stand here on the bottom , you give them a page and the other side of it .
where do they do ?
yes .
<unk> acid .
except here .
these are the <unk> .
or , you say , you have the character .
i love my <unk> , and i do n't like to call a <unk> <unk> so .
okay .
but it 's a form of behavior that connects with the age .
not just fly .
and we could actually take the <unk> of the fly through the <unk> of a <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> back .
and the <unk> that were in the brain were <unk> .
this is , it does n't just be <unk> by <unk> , but also to prevent diseases .
and that 's important , because we do n't want to stop the normal drug .
it does n't make sense to get time to control .
and i do n't want to leave you , if you 're going to take a little bit of resistance .
now , <unk> <unk> .
it 's not about you to lose weight or that .
in fact , in fact , there 's been a few people in austria , a <unk> group of <unk> people who have a day , and a day .
this is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> centre .
and that makes it very good .
this is , it 's <unk> .
buy it .
it does n't seem to be complex consciously seem to be dangerous .
it 's really messy .
and what you know is that <unk> are obese is to keep diabetes , even when they are .
and you also think that carrots can increase the growth of tumors .
here you can find out there , you see , <unk> <unk> .
after 30 days , they all dead dead .
there 's a little <unk> of glucose .
to create a <unk> effect .
there 's just an example , it works in almost all organisms .
and eat their food .
or <unk> the gift of a lot or <unk> .
you know , you know , you know , you know , <unk> -- and <unk> cancer .
this is not based on cartoons .
so , we 're trying to square degrees in the winter , and vitamin d is produced by sunlight on the skin .
now , take a couple of three months per week for a hour , and it 's crazy .
today , despite the newly <unk> examples , they have <unk> 10 to 40 years .
now , in fact , in fact , in the middle of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> it .
the impact of writing and blood pressure on earth 's disease .
because makoko lost almost like women .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , live longer than <unk> .
<unk> life longer than <unk> .
but more life still live longer than <unk> .
only <unk> die at the same time .
what is that ?
people think that 's what it has to do .
nm : so that 's just easy .
now , when i 'm a <unk> on the window , i 'm talking about <unk> <unk> .
and what 's probably happening in your eye .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> , and whatever , what you 're going to do with color under brain cells .
so , there 's alcohol .
there 's a very successful partner or a family or a family partner .
you do n't want to live on a whole neighborhood .
now think about the <unk> .
but this has nothing to do with <unk> .
it 's about <unk> .
you can measure the way that you 've got a lot of the streets in the world , it 's more <unk> .
and so , when he says , i 've tried to get some time .
i can do good at all right now , and i 'm not doing science .
absolutely not .
he has more <unk> in the blood and that 's bad .
technology should be accused of leadership because of <unk> .
and we know now , this is a lot of a great evolutionary effects .
in fact , it 's <unk> <unk> .
and we also know that , and we also know that companies are <unk> ,
so the fact that we were able to imagine , and we were able to do with <unk> and so forth .
no longer sense .
so many studies show that dark chocolate can <unk> itself .
so recently , there 's a beautiful research program that showed that this is about the <unk> of chocolate per day , the <unk> of a <unk> .
now , you have a look at your pocket here , you know , of course , you know .
there are studies that show you , there are studies that do n't show .
what 's happening is , is that coffee is diabetes to diabetes , and therefore their disposal depend on .
and it 's also a good design process , because he designed <unk> , how we could show ourselves with <unk> <unk> .
now , very nice and wonderful study in the suburbs , from 70,000 years , looked at the fact that people , every day , every day , every day , every day , four people eat their <unk> for 20 percent .
this is a massive value for extraordinary research study .
and this is for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
not because of the <unk> molecules are actually .
they 're going to get through their shoes , please .
but that 's actually not practical .
so it does n't matter .
and the next point is a little bit of the one .
now , if you look at the face of a lot of other proteins , so that 's meat , and only , when they are between <unk> and <unk> .
now , a very nice new study showed that , if you take a lot of different proteins , they want to get their <unk> times as much as if they were a big deal .
this is not for the time that europa proteins are good , and it 's not really important for the kids that they use it , and it does n't want to be .
they 're <unk> <unk> .
whatever they do , they were tired of adversity , who said , `` well , the dutch , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the health .
it 's all <unk> 's in the garage .
this is the gentleman <unk> <unk> that he was about for the last year , and he 's been <unk> years old .
he comes from my home <unk> from the <unk> , he 's never been sick .
and he goes very good .
he 's not a <unk> lenses that no turing is not a <unk> , where there are particularly many <unk> .
it has been <unk> by the <unk> that i told you today .
we should n't satisfy all of these <unk> experiments , but not a question .
well , that 's why the <unk> of this <unk> i did n't do a biological , and it starts to be a <unk> .
you think about the old people who need less , and it could be one of the <unk> mistakes in our culture .
<unk> wrote the biggest novel of the war a year .
the mother <unk> .
one work , with a lot of <unk> , mostly the robert <unk> .
thank you for your attention .
i want to start with a question i want to ask you .
one question , where do you have to do , because who is a little bit of the page that you have ?
the <unk> is very low .
less than i thought .
but it does n't have to remember why they do n't have any people who have people like this .
lots of people resigned and <unk> and think that would be <unk> .
that 's not the case at all .
now , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , actually , is an important part of people as well .
maybe it 's because they 're not born , because the question is universal .
do you feel overwhelmed or is you ?
you can be willing to be angry .
and you can be a lonely plan for sure .
there 's actually a lot of time to do with it .
and so , this is , now , some of these are now going to be <unk> here .
well , technologically leads to e , and it 's truthful .
we need a lot of time .
and so , now , here 's not a few seconds ago in the couple of seconds i have to give you .
we need to have an <unk> .
and it 's not even time to get their attention to you .
and of course , the need to be able to talk about it .
and we do n't have to do this exercise .
we do n't have the language even though we have to take any judgments for ourselves when we commit ?
there are part of the two two verses i 've always done .
the part of humanity says , is , at least in advertising .
now , for the past of death , you 're just advertising .
there 's a few moments in life where you can .
these people go to <unk> , and they get all day .
i do n't have time to do it .
and then there is people to be less <unk> , which is linked to everything .
so i do n't actually do it , so i 'm just part of the big universe .
and there are the great group , and i think , is that the time you think .
i think , okay , well , today , i 'm happy , and the next day , right , it 's all together .
now , when we think about it , we 're always going to have a huge amount of success .
the part of the stygimoloch , the vast majority of a millimeter .
but what we 're talking about these <unk> <unk> , i 'm not supposed to talk about , but i want to talk about the little bit about the <unk> , where i 'm going to have in this theater .
i do n't want to talk about saving and <unk> .
we know , in other words , we do n't seem to be particularly hard to come back to us .
and the older rock <unk> , in the course of a few pictures i 've shown you .
how easy it will always happen to another .
and we do n't know if these people have really been in this moment ,
but whoever does n't know the moment in the <unk> radius , where you think all , you know , you know , every single person in the corner , and you do n't want to get it .
all of these pieces of things are all right now .
now , maybe some of them might have started today .
what you 're looking at the mobile phone is very often , and that 's why , in fact , that 's <unk> , the <unk> on the mobile phone , you know , like this .
we look carefully carefully when you look .
so what we 're not doing now .
yes , and then there 's the part of the <unk> , and that 's why , in fact , there are the <unk> of a <unk> on the <unk> of six months , and you have a conversation in hope that you do n't have the letter .
these are the <unk> that you see from the outside .
that we teach other people .
but i 'm sure , there are also people in the room that i 've got to share their whole life so that you 've been trying to do with this one of these <unk> .
and there 's also in this room , people who are willing to do because they have to share other people because they have to share other people because they 're interested in a radius of death .
there are nothing that many people , are people who are connected to them , they feel feeling .
and there are people who have lost their lives themselves , and they do n't have a healthy job , and they 're not advertising .
i <unk> the <unk> .
and acromegaly is their <unk> .
the electromagnetic spectrum is us .
these are people who talk to social disorders .
and that 's also relatively relatively .
there is no longer number , there are no more democratic number when someone else wants to be when they do n't .
and then it goes back to the old people .
it 's the chemistry form of a part .
but in fact , in all of our lives , in all , in fact , in lots of thousands of people in facebook , or without twitter or facebook , these systems are more efficient .
you can be linked to hundreds of people with no one of your own people .
is it in the <unk> of the relationships of human relations , that it is in the digital range of relationships .
the two forms of loneliness is very often alone .
and this is also that the natural <unk> is a little bit startling .
whereas the digital shell is good for <unk> and cement in <unk> .
it 's the case of digital technology into the future when the possibility to connect with .
i do n't know if you 're in the last couple of weeks , i think that 's what i 'm going to do to do with this very , very <unk> .
or think of what we find is a new type .
but these are also the same generation of our generation .
so more importantly than the groundbreaking self is the fear of the part of the success and from the fear of the part of the people are willing to do .
<unk> , the great <unk> , the <unk> person has a wonderful <unk> .
this is what people do all do not to be alone .
they build cathedrals , and they have kids who are willing to commit again .
but the <unk> did not get off the fear of the <unk> , of money .
<unk> go .
good things .
in fact , the crux of the sophistication , because it has been helpful for a while that the items itself themselves .
now , the problem is , it 's very short , and it makes it to take this separation against ecology .
that 's why we need to use new things for us .
i 've been reading the advertising for a <unk> <unk> .
and the <unk> movement is very <unk> from the communication chain , which is about it .
now , that 's what 's going to do with that , you know , but it does it work .
so in fact , there 's nothing to do with the <unk> of shaker-dom , and people like this .
<unk> <unk> has a wonderful poem .
come on your heart , who knows ?
in a relationship , or , in the creative , or the other of the other domains , and the other way to look at the same time , i do n't want to be angry depressed and the question , who is this man ?
am i going to do something about this ?
one study says that in the <unk> women , who are married , someone with me .
so , sadly , because i do n't even know if i did n't have the study myself , so often i told me .
but it 's all not to do because it 's actually not working on trial today , and the reaction is always the same thing that people are taught me .
so the idea of this is pretty soon , almost like a waterfall .
we have a lot of <unk> , and we do n't talk about them .
i 'm talking about this in the talk of sex .
and that 's probably true every day .
so while you 're <unk> , you know , what do i do right now ?
who is this person in my bed ?
and also , in a form of creation , not necessarily what 's needed to do with the quality of the moral .
nothing to do with all the quality of relationship .
it 's just always there .
we do n't talk about them because we do n't look at it .
we do n't talk about it in the workforce .
in the workforce , of course , of course , is <unk> than we think .
i was called <unk> <unk> , and i looked at a group of five <unk> , so i said three legs , and send his face and two <unk> .
the two men have been <unk> , these two women are in the 1890s .
and in the case , in this case , a little bit of <unk> , a little bit of <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> .
i understand that i 'm not going to tell you that you can not look at you , so you can not put it in this stance , of course , every one of all , in fact , is that you 've got to say ,
it 's the <unk> of the <unk> .
but it 's also the <unk> of the <unk> .
we all know the <unk> or i see here , you might look at the lives of your life .
in <unk> , in <unk> , in usa-land , you do n't often know who are actually what they do .
where you 're looking at .
and also , this is a form of success .
just like that , as it can be <unk> , like terrorism can be <unk> .
it 's a <unk> .
and so , a <unk> story tells me that he was explained by a customer , and he said , it 's what 's wrong .
it was a <unk> in the middle of the <unk> .
this is where he did .
and two months later , he goes .
so the ai never come up .
it 's always in connection with other feelings .
she has beautiful thinkers , and it has <unk> .
the cool <unk> we know .
yes , anger , anger and kindness .
but we should n't forget the beautiful siblings .
the freedom is the pride to the desire .
that 's why i 'm looking at the dynamics .
come and live in the life like a <unk> and the north .
so let 's try and throw it out of her .
because there 's a little bit worse than the part of this , and that 's the empty , which may be the size of the bush , if you do n't know .
crisis is part of life .
for example , i 've been fascinated with an unprecedented number of success .
now , one of my favorite verses i do n't have more than a <unk> dictator for me that i 've always told him why he told me about him , because i thought i 'd like to say , `` i want to ask people , maybe i 'm afraid .
i 've been working since i 've been working since i 've been studying the groundbreaking of my life , and i come to work on .
that 's what it is with the <unk> that you do .
i 've got to be the city .
people were able to buy it , and they would n't be able to find out how to come from a steak or even a partnership .
as a child , i found my parents incredibly embarrassing .
you can not do that in a <unk> , you ca n't have a conversation .
whether in the <unk> or in the economy .
each time , it took to an alarming rate .
and as a kid , i found that as i was <unk> .
as a young adult , i 've been able to use it to have this openness .
but in fact , i 've been working on myself , and i 've been working on myself , and i also have to take myself to work myself and again .
you see , you know , `` you 're going to be ready for you to get the next demo .
thank you very much .
yeah , thank you very much .
i 've met three capsizes .
it 's a <unk> and a <unk> .
and why are i talking to you all , what do you want to protect you ?
most people would decide for the <unk> .
and that 's a fake good idea .
and why ?
because we are using the power of the biggest effect .
in health , we 'll do it differently .
this is what we 're going to do the biggest effect on the largest effect of the 20th century .
we decide for instance , for example , for example , for example , we 're headed for books .
big <unk> and large .
for me , that 's not so valuable .
or we decide for the <unk> .
that 's for millennia .
but very big <unk> , but it 's still very good .
for me , that 's not so valuable .
and i want to tell you how to share with the <unk> of the greatest <unk> .
if you 're talking about germs and health care , you 're not going to go on a scale .
and the subject is called the yaodongs .
and the topic was in germany for no long time , about the <unk> .
and then the number of employees had lost in germany .
and i asked myself , what was going on in the <unk> ?
so why did this look like this time ?
and then i did research , and i 've become <unk> .
because it was exactly in the years .
what was there ?
there 's been <unk> to germany .
and we 're always going to be over and <unk> ?
and i looked at myself .
<unk> comes from germany .
and that 's going to happen .
and at the age of <unk> , the curve is still going on .
and what happens to germany ?
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
and we 're always going to be over and <unk> ?
well , i 've got one and one .
because it 's obvious .
<unk> power .
and of course , i 'm not talking today to tell you that kids are cheap .
because that 's not true .
but one thing we have in common now .
the <unk> of all new applications -- and <unk> did n't get to be <unk> and healthier .
so what is it ?
the surgery ?
and there 's a wonderful study over the states .
and then the problem with consumers .
and you have in the <unk> <unk> .
and then you wanted to look at what 's happening here ?
and they 've seen that people are still less likely to be healthy , but people are still less likely to be less restrained .
and this was chapter .
and therefore it 's called <unk> .
what can we explain that ?
and you can imagine the body as a power station .
so here we have so that we are so smart .
and on the one hand , a <unk> , because we 're going to put all the <unk> on this .
and here 's the energy consumption .
now , if we now , we 're going to be more <unk> in our power when we are at the other side of the energy , and it makes it <unk> .
the human body does n't form the line .
it can prompt energy .
and that 's in the form of fat .
our latest and <unk> <unk> .
but what happens when we 've done a few times as we heard about energy , and yet it 's going to take the energy , and it 's going to have a chance .
it 's produced every gallon .
there 's no life at all .
we 're only our kids .
and that 's what happened .
our grandparents are <unk> six months old .
and we 're going to go back in a mile , two kilometers , and these are the positive effects .
there are studies that come from about five -- until <unk> feet .
i 'm going to tell you that a little bit about my friend mike .
do you read the chair back ?
hello , would you skim stones ?
hello is americans .
he 's shy , he does n't get a lot .
and he was at the study of the trial and he 's here .
he 's this typical <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and he has a <unk> in the hand .
and mike works still , and still , less and more and more and more and more and more and more and more , and it will always go .
why ?
because mike 's already .
and i was looking at how much movement was so close to the day , and i looked at it in the paper , and i went back .
and there 's been a thousand illustrations .
so this was like the next time that mike 's left on the couch to the car in the office with the car in the office , and you go back to the back of the back .
and he came in a thousand steps .
this is mike , at the day , 10 minutes of his eye .
<unk> soldiers , and every morning was mike , hi .
through this conditions , disease is today .
and mike will not be <unk> , because he 's too late because it 's a long time because it 's still going to be <unk> , but they will be <unk> and <unk> the energy .
and at the same time , the energy , as you see here in your <unk> .
but energy is <unk> , which is not there .
the <unk> show up at the blood .
and also , you know , it 's associated with <unk> and <unk> on his <unk> .
so the <unk> .
so , if the energy consumption in the blood , then the doctors are getting resistant to clean energy and poor .
and this triptych , the <unk> , like <unk> , it turns out there are little holes in these <unk> .
and there 's another case at this whole galaxy , and it 's about all the little lines , and we talk about <unk> or <unk> .
and now , the heart of the heart is right under pressure , because now we have to take the blood through these <unk> <unk> ,
and when this goes down to this is a <unk> , then it 's also in the body .
and if that 's at the heart of the heart , we call the teacher .
and when this is in the head , we 're going to get this facility .
and in germany alone every single day , for three minutes .
that means , in germany , every single one of them .
and yet , it 's not injured ; it 's not a musician .
and if you do n't know that these things , you 're always looking at the wrong place .
for example , for example .
i 've been a <unk> of zimbabwe , and i 'm going to make a bunch of toothpicks in arabic , and there are <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and if every one of this book , there 's just a year somewhere , and we would take a 30 feet of 700 <unk> of <unk> .
and i read this firsthand .
and so , in fact , and so , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , if it 's really important when they get more energy than they try to get it .
and if you take a lot of energy as you decide , they 'll sell you .
that 's gorgeous .
but why are we going to do that ?
this is just one step .
but the need is , of course , is huge .
because why are 55 pounds to 1,000 pounds ?
because it 's a diet , no one .
what are the consequences that we spend here in the last couple of weeks , and here 's five weeks later , when we go back to this struggle , again , in the normal stage , to the normal communities .
what 's next year after five or seven weeks ?
nothing .
except <unk> and again , a <unk> in the quarries that we did n't have to do .
so , you can learn from every new diet , every single person 's behavior , and you want to get them into your daily basis in your lifetime .
yes or no ?
and if you go .
and if you 're not going to stay it .
because if you 're not talking about it , it 's horrifying .
it 's the investors who are going to decide whether they 're healthy or healthy .
these are the bad habits that makes us .
and it 's the good habits that we do .
and when mike comes back in the mirror , it will see the result of his daily lives .
when mike comes into the mirror , it looks out its daily habits .
and when mike comes into the mirror , and it 's actually , you see where it is on .
because when he does more bad habits as good as it is , in fact , he 's used to the disease .
and when mike comes to the future of your goals , the creator of his dreams , it does n't have to get all the lives .
and it 's just just a little bit more than bad .
and a german habits of mike 's also a great example of the person 's a strange animal .
so , again , it 's going to be for example , and it has a lot of his <unk> <unk> by the rest of his way through the car , all the way that you go through every car , every <unk> .
and finally , he sits behind the couch , and it 's got to go into <unk> .
so he 's going to take his ass in the freezer with the canoe , and in fact , a name is actually about <unk> , and it will be like a <unk> band , so it 's going to go back out .
and my grandparents would be exactly how they were .
it was a <unk> , and it did n't work .
the only said , family is not to do .
and somehow he 's right .
why do we have to look at the end of our brief clothing , how do we have in our daily basis ?
so , in addition , we 've been working on this <unk> of two hours a day .
but it 's much more easy to find the movement back where we lost it .
in the daily lives .
and so i said , `` i 'm going to give you a <unk> . ''
you know , even though you 're looking at the situation , you 're going to go back to you , and you get a long time , and i realized that in the first series , is not a place .
and that 's what you 're looking for , and that 's what you 're looking at that <unk> in our <unk> .
we 're always going to stop the jokes .
we give our <unk> so we have the <unk> process .
we have our entire life that we 've got to do the <unk> problems , but we do n't really go to where we are .
it 's in a very different direction .
and so you can see the <unk> scans , and the movement back there , where it is a little bit .
i 'm going to talk to my own .
and i 'm the only person who 's going on , and it 's open up and down and forth .
but when i say , i 've been time for me .
and then i <unk> the movement that 's just like this .
and if you look at the top of the <unk> , 30 minutes of music , tell me .
<unk> steps .
that 's about three minutes 10 .
and a more elegant steps , if you 're talking about today every day , you know , when they do n't know , you know , at the end of the day , you know , that you 're not marinated in your body .
that might seem like a little bit .
but as a <unk> , as long as a year , long time ago , we went from four , five pounds of fat .
we do n't have in our bodies .
and you give me a little bit about me , i 'm going to get rid of it .
the americans are nuts , the ones like this .
this is a <unk> of five pounds .
in fact , i 'm four lbs .
just to look at this little demo .
and if that 's the effect of the effect is from this perspective , which is what happens when you really understand in a commodity .
and so this <unk> that you see , every day in your daily lives .
when you 're at <unk> steps per day , they go through all odds .
and if you 're looking for time and time , you 'll get the outside .
then they have the same time as the <unk> .
and then you get also faster and faster .
but you do n't do your health anymore .
they do n't make their health anymore , and they do n't do it by their actions .
because most importantly , this is the most important thing to do now .
and i 'm going to make a health research .
and for me , it 's more than a lot of myself , for me , it 's a testament to understand a bit of purpose for life and for me .
because i think , if you do n't have to do with what we should do or do .
but health has to do what we want .
and so i 'm just talking about this idea for you .
if you only talk about the best .
and , you know , you know .
on a step .
thank you very much .
<unk> like this , there 's a glacier da vinci , and so there 's been a beautiful way of looking at the world with other eyes ?
and when it 's all over time , what was a lot of the time , 2100 ?
now , could we do this ?
would you think about rewards ?
and how can we do with power and confidence for our future ?
let 's start to think about what we do at least ?
yes .
now , the extraordinary inventions of technology has developed the federal government of the federal government .
so , you know me .
that 's all great .
and we can be proud of the pride to be proud of it , and we have a lot of our technology that we can get together in the world that we can be good about this .
now , as we have a fantastic amount of wealth , unique prosperity .
but how does it look at the future ?
what are the challenges that we have to do as a society ?
and who cares about the big quality and social challenges ?
so , it seems to be really used to happen .
a kind of mismatch .
so the economy is to reduce the ecological challenges because the diet is a lot of effort that we get productivity and efficiency .
and the world 's better can do better to use , or more and more and more and more and more and better , and they also have to be able to create the company of the economy economy .
at least , <unk> <unk> .
but who says that we have to do the same thing ?
how would it be , if we were using our <unk> and social solutions ?
when technologies innovation is also developed innovation ?
when economic innovations , however , social innovation ?
so when we think differently ?
now , when we do so , if we do so , if we have a lot of these new forces , and if we 're trying to do a lot of a <unk> , low <unk> ?
because how did that ?
both sides were to do it , right ?
can we do that ?
ask yourself .
and so we have always been as a smartphone .
now there are positive examples .
charles conducted with his <unk> , with his <unk> in bangladesh , a lot of poverty .
and yet , more importantly , at least the <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> <unk> .
and he has <unk> as an entrepreneur , as he 's got to be <unk> .
so , in the same time , i 'm going to do a <unk> of somebody known for someone .
anyway , i can be <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
well , a lot of death , but also its enemy .
and yeah , so , <unk> .
i like to get the wrong .
and if you can look at this , you think , think of your enemies , we do n't have to worry about our future .
yes , so at the time , he started working on here , and then , in the course of the time , he started working on a course of our <unk> <unk> .
this is what it does .
and this is what he 's done with him , and it 's also very successful .
and yet , there 's still in that .
so he 's not even more interested in me ?
and this is a <unk> , it 's always .
<unk> are <unk> .
and that 's what it means .
and it 's also like these <unk> .
so the right thing is , of course , the <unk> , it turns out .
so it does n't seem to tell him , but it 's like the <unk> tell him .
and there in the middle of the fire , he did n't know .
so , more than it was surprised as much as it was used to be <unk> .
it 's called mister apple .
and as a result , a hundred months ago , he started .
that 's great joy , so with young people , they get his experience .
and the two were then found it in the same time .
and most of them were lost .
what would it be as if we 're just going to be in this with these two times ?
( apple <unk> , so it was like this .
so what is the difference between the <unk> between the <unk> between the <unk> between the <unk> between the <unk> of the hundreds of businesses ?
i did n't have the same thing .
yes , so , do we start thinking about the question of what 's called <unk> ?
so , he 's right .
<unk> markets , including products , natural customers , there 's a <unk> .
and you can also see quite a bit like this , you have a big form of data .
and as a result of valuable applications , even if the very slowly is able to get it .
so what 's actually a <unk> ?
so , <unk> , you 're <unk> , you know , so you 're not sure it 's not just a little rodent of a big company .
it 's something very different .
it 's a completely different character .
because it does n't do it .
no <unk> customers , no <unk> <unk> , nothing is known .
so this is a basic organization that a fantastic organization is to make sense of a business model , to find out whether it 's acting , of course , is unsustainable .
and you can see sure that it 's important in particular ways of other ways , in other ways , in other ways .
yeah , that 's me .
but after what happens ?
so , i 'm going to ask myself , then i 'm going to make a little bit more <unk> money ?
so i said , `` well , the way it 's too good for me to make sure .
this is <unk> .
as you 've got your company , you 've got to create your business life , and after the <unk> of your life .
oh . ''
what is real ?
what do you think of yourself , when you 've got to <unk> your heart money , what is your shirt ?
so you take a career as a <unk> <unk> or what ?
what happens to your finger , how do you know ?
and then we look at the <unk> .
so the statistics about <unk> , you do n't have a <unk> perspective , because uncontrolled percent of all of the <unk> are a few years ago , and at least , you know , there 's a lot more <unk> a little bit higher than a thousand .
now , money is always the result of a successful enterprise and a good definition .
well , money is a big deal for creativity .
and it 's all the human power .
but it 's never the goal of a company .
yes , what is the goal ?
the surgery ?
so , if i do that , i do n't know what to do when i 'm not going to do it .
and so , statistics , they have always been responsible for the same time , and so on .
and if i do n't have it all , i 'm not going to ask myself , and how do i do n't know what i am ?
so that makes me a good feeling .
so , as i 'm trying to decide , and so , that sounds like me to me , and that 's what you want to do .
yeah , i 'm going to <unk> .
but i 'm going to wait for you .
that 's one .
so , it 's actually <unk> , so it 's gone .
hundreds of millions of generation of generation .
a <unk> for <unk> .
so , how do you say today ?
<unk> i do ?
so we 're going to get even more <unk> .
in particular , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
so it helps help .
i 'm going to tell you about this .
okay .
yeah , thank you , mister <unk> .
but there is just questions .
so , you can imagine that there 's a important aspect of questions about good questions .
can we understand that at the end of the other things that i want to understand better ?
so the first is , i 'm here , and what do i want to do here ?
yes , <unk> , there 's the way you 're looking for you , that 's bigger than you ?
what are you talking to the world ?
so , what are people when they work with you ?
what are you ready for ?
what are your phones , maybe , <unk> machines ?
so why is this important ?
because that 's your <unk> <unk> .
and how did we learn ?
if you do n't want to have a ship , you do n't use the men together , you do n't get a lot of wood , you know , it 's a little bit of <unk> .
yes , good .
so i 'll ask the next question .
what is my favorite species ?
what does that mean ?
yeah , now now , you have your goal .
now , the fishes in detail , or not <unk> , you know , when you ask you , what you do n't want to stay .
do you remember the story with the cold elephant ?
take me a little bit .
not ?
<unk> acid .
so , check out .
now , you do n't want to have a perfect <unk> .
okay ?
do it work ?
so no pink elephant .
right ?
no pink elephant .
you know ?
this is what we want to focus on what we do n't want .
what is the only way of the only way ?
how many gs ?
yes , let me tell you what you want .
so the <unk> <unk> or maybe the <unk> of the <unk> .
but you think about it .
by the way , what do you think is going to be useful , right ?
i read a paper .
remove the way you want the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
anyone ?
in fact , at the top of the <unk> , you know , <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> to nepal .
i <unk> <unk> of you about the <unk> of the <unk> of the time , which is the first interval of <unk> .
i <unk> the glass in the <unk> .
i think about the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i 'm talking about <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> broccoli .
oh , ma'am , <unk> <unk> ?
delusions were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , you know , a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
this is a <unk> of <unk> .
the real <unk> is actually <unk> <unk> ?
and look like this one ?
is yours that ?
anybody else ?
okay .
okay , and that 's the same .
okay .
so , then we look at what 's going on .
it 's gorgeous .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
anyone ?
in fact , at the top of the <unk> , you know , <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> to nepal .
i <unk> <unk> of you about the <unk> of the <unk> of the time , which is the most beautiful thing .
i <unk> the glass in the <unk> .
i think about the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i 'm talking about <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> broccoli .
and <unk> , how do you do it ?
so , i know , i was shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i first saw .
i thought i could n't be .
and more importantly , i was able to get through the head , it was that i was able to do the whole time around the area ?
through my life .
and okay , i really appreciate that .
in order to look at the <unk> <unk> that we 've heard of our perception and our <unk> .
but what happens next ?
what was the tale of this , and what did i do ?
and so you can think of what you can think of your perception , because it can be a big <unk> rate .
all right , thank you , you can ask for the next question .
how did i have to come to my goal ?
so , that 's what i think is a good question .
i mean , i do n't like that , and i do n't think differently .
yes , <unk> , there 's a good message for you .
it 's going to be able to keep them as you can do it .
because when you hear it , you know , your inner materials , and if you get rid of your mind , you know , you 're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it in your body .
almost everyone .
you can not be different from a while that you can do in terms of things like you .
these are the <unk> <unk> that you have in the morning .
and even better questions i was asking for you , where you could , where you could ask them to ask them to make more <unk> to you .
and you also have a big deal .
the <unk> have just been <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , when she did n't even know , it was in his <unk> meeting .
for lunch for the famous big course .
and it 's pretty different people .
so scientists , <unk> , politicians , musicians , <unk> , architects , architects , and <unk> ,
but not in our modern world , where what was going on , yes , who cares ?
who 's right ?
it 's because of all of these different types of things , that they had no idea of what could possibly be able to do .
all right , yeah , the next question is about the next step ?
<unk> because there are successful entrepreneurs in the reason .
instead of touch and <unk> and so forth , you just want to look at the next step .
because what do you want to do ?
but these are going to do a very angry , and all of the mysteries .
and if it was nothing about me , well , she would look at some other step .
and even if the big bang , there is no longer other .
so it 's so important that you know .
this is where the inner safety .
and in the rest of all , how did we learn ?
even though we did n't know , and we did n't know ?
you say , `` oh , you know , you have to say <unk> .
so , in this context , you know , that 's what you 're looking at this , and this kind of crap closer to look at it is the best force in a company .
and this is also exactly the <unk> of the uncertainty that makes us forever .
yeah , hear mister <unk> .
so this sounds really cool .
but i do n't know , in my business , i 'm going to show you a lot of gloves there .
and again , in germany , it 's always like this kind of up-sweep .
and i 'm going to tell you , because the politicians was interested in .
okay , my boy , <unk> .
so , go back to water .
what do you think , how many people can you change ?
ten ?
<unk> ?
ten million ?
look at this .
who are you ?
right , that .
and that 's what you can do is to change .
or to say that mahatma gandhi is to change the change you 're in your world .
do you think beautiful beauty and big examples , but how does it work ?
there we have a lot of <unk> <unk> on our <unk> .
there 's a lot of interest in the <unk> or <unk> , or if you feel guilty for something , or you have to do with you .
and when you ask yourself in these situations , what do you learn despite all right now , you know , you know , you know , you 're going to feel powerful .
oh , you know , what you 're looking for you are familiar with you .
and in the end , you know what you 've seen from this crisis , or what 's wrong .
so , if i 've done , when i 've come to me , that 's what i 've done .
it 's good .
<unk> <unk> .
and do you really think that my work is to me ?
it 's right .
and you take a lot of two things .
first , a lot of the top of the glass of the glass of the inner knee , <unk> it up to her .
because that 's your perception .
and for the second 10 seconds to your inner attitude .
because that 's what you 're looking for the other people around you .
we can change our own perception .
are you to do that ?
yeah , i think .
thank you <unk> .
all sorts of <unk> <unk> .
yes .
what do you think about our <unk> ?
okay .
right , right ?
and how do we think about this <unk> ?
is that a new <unk> ?
i mean , yes .
it 's very simple .
and i 'm looking at the <unk> .
<unk> means <unk> .
and that 's what the <unk> is really .
an <unk> of the <unk> of the fishermen .
and no , so new <unk> , <unk> .
that 's the <unk> .
the most famous <unk> of the great famous names .
so robert 's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> or whatever they are .
but let 's just take this to new .
and that 's because it 's going to happen to our <unk> of the next 37 years .
you see right , i 'm <unk> .
so , if it 's like , i would argue to me with kids and their future , because they are kids .
instead of the way , i think that 's most of the time .
i have a lot of my life in prison .
about four years ago , my father and i have the program to create creativity .
we 're <unk> <unk> , which means they can do better in the workplace , or where they can make a patient they can .
so why were i talking to me about <unk> , so , the people who 've made the great mistake ?
our program is very easy to understand how to raise kids .
and i would say that the <unk> of the last place in the universe is going to work .
what do you think it 's the most important factor in childhood , and what do we work ?
we found that there are positive models of technical models .
and if you think about why , there are so many <unk> , and so many districts are often whether it 's not the case that he 's not a lot of work that he is drugs that he is drugs that he 's drugs .
and if there 's a <unk> boy about what 's going to happen in his life , it may not be a better idea , like a life , because he has no better .
and he <unk> his dad .
i 'm going to introduce you for me martin .
martin is <unk> <unk> .
his father was <unk> and did all the family of life .
when he was 12 , his mother died , and he had to take a little brother and his little brother .
there 's the <unk> of the big bang .
he was born , and <unk> the perfect victim .
and at the same time as a small brother in a mangrove brother , which was used to this floor .
and he was talking about in the middle of the first time the <unk> , and he went to the shoes .
and in this day , he was <unk> .
and here it goes .
he was talking about his life just like his father .
now , how do you think i 'm talking about , right ?
after the age of death , many of them are many of them , many of them are many of them .
you do n't know a lot of other than your <unk> activity and their carroças .
and then they 're going to be a few people with people , and that 's what it 's like , your thoughts for the same way that they do n't have to be good .
so , what do you think , what do people think differently ?
no longer good .
and they 're better better in the <unk> .
they sell their drugs at a higher level , and try to stay in the neighborhood where they could come home .
and this is going to germany in germany .
this is , in germany , every day at the end of the heart of indigenous peoples .
but then you have people in jail .
but also , these people have a <unk> on their forehead .
and there 's <unk> .
and everywhere you 're going to get is your first identity .
now , if you look at a lifetime of view , if you look at a web , whether you want to create new private relationships , you 'll be able to create new private relationships , allowing you to create a identity , which is a tendency to make a difference in society .
that 's the problem we are .
how do we try to solve this problem ?
what are you going to think , how many people are doing ?
you will be surprised .
it 's <unk> skills .
if you have a <unk> , you 've heard of <unk> , from <unk> and from <unk> .
in the same time , he was a little bit of <unk> , because it 's not <unk> in jail .
and these properties , we 're going to use for some smart .
we start our program with a <unk> training in prison , in three ways .
we are bridging the <unk> of education .
each other attribute , in their own shoes , and every one of his work is part of a <unk> .
and then we 're looking at the end of the <unk> , in the <unk> of the <unk> of their personal relations and also , in a way .
what do we get in your program ?
it 's a big bandwidth , from the <unk> of the order for the future .
we have a <unk> of it .
a very large bandwidth , and i 'm going to introduce you to ted .
<unk> <unk> talent and his illusion of all money , it has been very close to sin .
he always had fun for doing business .
he 's been <unk> for the first time .
and this dish did n't seem to be quite funny .
it 's in the opposite .
he 's talking about him , he 's got to the last night ,
and he 's been <unk> for the second .
and he took over the other part of this , and then on the <unk> .
and it turns out how he could use his own talent for something .
he 's been recruited in september 13 year , then he called his language for <unk> .
the answer is ugly , he can live in it .
he has very good <unk> .
he 's here today .
and i want to ask you to talk to you talk about it .
let me go back to martin , i said to him .
now , martin was an education for a royal car , and he went to his hometown in the <unk> .
and there were alcohol and drugs in the 1960s were his cycle of it .
he worked together as a <unk> and as <unk> .
six years he 's got this life .
and he says today that he 's been doing with this money that has not been <unk> .
and one day he asked someone in a <unk> so much that he was mad .
and he took over the <unk> part , and the most exciting thing has changed his life .
he learned to be able to be able to be able to save more success and more and more quality of his own or without drugs .
and he was so excited about his view that he would like to read it .
and he wanted to be part of the <unk> .
this is suffering .
he 's now talking about a number of years ago , and <unk> our participants in their lifetime , because he knows what if you want to change in , and if you can change the right tools with the hand , it 's going to be able to change the right tools .
the u.n. of these successes are the people like them .
people who are struggling with us to stop our participants in their disposal with their personal designs .
these are our <unk> , the <unk> talks in our <unk> , who are students to make us the <unk> ,
and these are our <unk> , who are our people talk to the supermarket .
and also , these people take a lot of our program .
a example .
we 're doing a machine called <unk> .
we put it in the middle of the room , and we have a big reversal of our participants in our place , and we are on the other side .
and i 'll ask different questions .
and everybody , when someone in the room , you see this question , it 's in the line .
and here 's what we all have in common , whether we are sitting in the smoke or the outside .
but also , where the differences are .
and one example of where the differences are , is the question .
i grew up in a call social histories , or i had a child in my 40s .
there are usually a lot of our participants at the beginning of the line , and we have a very few of us .
so the question i want to do is to ask ourselves all the things i want to ask you .
i 'm going to tell you all of you .
maybe we can be a little light in the audience .
i can see it .
it 's all .
seriously .
thank you very much .
i 'm going to ask you a question , and if you 're using this question , you 're just waiting for you .
this is , our new line we are now .
i was able to do things in my life , i 've been able to be gay .
if you ask this question , you 're going to ask you .
and it turns out to be <unk> .
it 's also , perhaps as opposed to have a lot of <unk> .
well , it 's not exactly what it should n't do .
okay .
and it 's also , all , they do n't always have to be all stressed up ,
all right .
most people .
we have a bunch of <unk> in space .
this is beautiful , because i 'm happy .
thank you very much , you can all come again .
in this question , if we ask them on the <unk> , our expansion is very often .
and there 's just how it might have been very lucky because they had .
now , with the parents , happiness with the environment , in which you 've got to do with the friends , but that you may not always be able to get out of the edge of the <unk> or whatever .
what are the results of our work ?
<unk> percent of our users find out within a few days after a <unk> rate .
it 's fast fast .
<unk> percent have already done .
one third of africa in the last year .
and our <unk> rate is about seven percent .
i was told that the <unk> of seven percent is one of the <unk> of <unk> percent .
i 'm <unk> .
it 's a <unk> increase in <unk> per year to reduce its revenue .
and it 's a beautiful <unk> , <unk> , which is a <unk> of seven percent of a dime of <unk> <unk> .
when my father and i 've been able to do this <unk> , we 've been really fascinated by pretty cool .
i 've been my youngest <unk> in a big corporation .
but i 've got to tell you , i 've been not in my life yet .
we encourage our participants to our responsibility .
what is happening in your life , and in terms of creating responsibility for your life .
do n't hide it , not to hide .
because it leads to a completely new set , and it will also get it to work .
and so this is what i 'm particularly interested and very proud of our participants in the way .
so , i have a little video here .
voice 1 .
so i was born in two years , and i went to 12 months of a <unk> .
i went to <unk> for the <unk> for three years and 10 years old .
i got to be <unk> .
so , i 've made my team for two years to do it .
i was known for <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
so , through my part of technology , actually changed my own life .
and what was important for me was that this is actually made .
because there was my self <unk> .
i was not <unk> , i was going to say , yes .
i forgot to laugh .
i 've been looking at a moment to see myself .
and you 're looking at a very different awareness and floral out of sleep .
it 's been more likely to be a lot better goals , and then you 're always going to go back to anything .
and so the wrong people do n't do it .
well , the problem is that many of them have no harm , if the box is .
so the biggest problem , because it 's automatically wins that you go back to the back .
you do n't know anything else .
so , by doing this <unk> , i do n't know what 's going to happen to me , about other people , i think about some of the stories , about the <unk> with the society , which is just a few weeks ago .
i 'm in the first woman for my first wife .
and for about six months , i went back with her .
so this is , we have a new relationship .
and because i 'm also working through this whole <unk> and a lot of other things .
i have a lot of experience .
i 'm in my family back to the education .
so i work today in my career , i 'm going to speak .
i 'm going to try to make a <unk> for me .
you 've got to realize that it 's very , very many people who are actually , like , for example , my <unk> now is still in the time , and in fact , i do n't know .
i 'm grateful for you to do the same thing that you have to do .
i 'm grateful for that , because of course , despite myself with ethnic issues , and i 'm extremely grateful that i needed to be part of it .
but of course , all the people who are people who were .
i 've been talking about many of people who have been talking about , and i 've always been able to say that it 's good for me .
and that 's what i do .
and that 's what i do .
come in prison .
each of them has something we can .
whether you 're treating our participants in your <unk> , whether you are as a <unk> , whether you 're supposed to be able to be in the financial sector .
now , if you want to take our program in a new category , a lot of time .
tell us .
martin luther , and i 'm here today .
and let 's look at the conversation with you .
thank you very much .
i 've sent to <unk> <unk> <unk> for a <unk> <unk> .
in a while , i was a <unk> experiment .
you do things like this .
<unk> for safety .
it 's called the <unk> .
one woman in the bible .
there is a lot of options , as you can do with <unk> .
and as you can measure .
anyway , i was <unk> <unk> .
so in my work , and so i 'm talking about <unk> .
now , i 'm really talking about <unk> .
and not from real problems .
my issue was , i was <unk> , and i 've seen exactly the same as my life living in 10 years .
it was <unk> .
and these <unk> found me .
and to make it harder .
and basically , i had a <unk> template .
<unk> like a living .
i do n't know , i do n't know the <unk> path ?
now , are just me ?
or what if i used to put my <unk> again ?
and look what happens .
and then welcome to me .
that was the idea .
i was a <unk> <unk> in a meeting .
as i said .
and the <unk> process was for me to get fijian <unk> .
you <unk> a lot of the world , in a good background , and <unk> the country on a very <unk> way .
but it 's also very <unk> countries .
in fact , in fact , there are more and more likely to find out about <unk> villages , but they do n't have to be improved happiness and joy .
right now , with these images and lifeless , but a half of them .
and that 's what i was thinking about for a while .
i did n't know what to do .
on that .
and also , i found it a little bit of <unk> from me about a country that i did n't understand .
i wanted to change .
i wanted to see nations .
<unk> <unk> .
and to get my personal interest .
how do you learn better countries ?
by sharing with people .
the people living in your life .
not in the hotel .
by the way , you get the challenges of the issues of people .
and you interact with people .
in addition , this is the answer i could ask for this question .
and i wanted to do .
and i wanted to do something more .
i wanted to make a risk .
something good .
and that sense has been bugging me in a <unk> period .
i 've been working in developing countries , but i did n't have a particularly obsessed with it .
by <unk> , there 's a <unk> civil society that were not only less dense and social problems .
with a $ 5 acres of grueling steel , is the poorest country in north america .
and again , for one of the three poorest countries in the world .
one quarter of the population lives in poverty .
almost a fifth of the population administration .
forty percent of peace ca n't read .
all of these facts are connected with lots and lots of different stories , and things that i spent on this journey was a while i was willing to do , and open for change .
so i wanted to change something .
and then , in my 20s , i 'm headed to my neck .
i quit my job .
and fortunately , for me .
and i 'm also interested in a way that one of the answer that i received on my neck .
because it 's just a <unk> .
this is about a serious ted talk at the international international corporation .
and it 's not about a <unk> mechanism for a <unk> <unk> that tries to spend a long time , and they 're trying to help their operations of their supporters .
hello ?
now , right ?
my boss was really serious , and good .
at least i thought .
and this answer was a <unk> <unk> .
i was really <unk> .
and finally , of course , there is a pretty strong answer .
and fortunately , never .
instead , i do n't really look at the very good feeling to make good news .
i used to use it as a motor to make my own company .
<unk> acid .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> .
a company that basically understood what i was looking at .
so , the possibility to get a different kind of land .
the possibility of the land get married .
and i can talk to the people who live .
and it can not be able to work somewhere , but in some <unk> .
<unk> , you can see in two words .
so <unk> and <unk> .
and that means that it can be so much like the place you can play with .
you can do good .
now this sounds trivial <unk> .
it 's not .
<unk> is a social <unk> .
we use phosphorus as a tool for sustainable .
well , as we can use <unk> as a tool for sustainable development .
so , <unk> , colorful and rich .
because the people who are attracted to us are mentally ill .
they pay for her journey , like at least another .
but they 're just different different .
they live in <unk> .
and the principle is not a lot of hackers , or not much cheaper , but they need to be <unk> .
social security .
and <unk> .
and so , our next thing that we 've got to do is to add our participants in terms of personal projects .
we can be able to cure for a very rich situation , in fact , there 's no chance to be a chance of long-term causes .
because the only infrastructure infrastructure is .
for other others , we can be sustainable activities .
we can make a variety of other projects .
so we 're spending to a hundred percent .
they do n't have to keep themselves .
and that 's what we 're talking about our <unk> <unk> honesty .
we started to work with our work .
<unk> year , we have our <unk> on uganda .
and now after about four years , i 've been asked , and my husband and i have a team to a <unk> question .
do we get the <unk> path ?
or what if we had to be bigger ?
now , when do we get the basics time ?
if we do n't just use social commitment , and avoid ourselves in our pockets ?
and so , what do the most important condition ?
or even more <unk> <unk> .
this is basically a new business company .
it 's a company that leads to companies .
but in other words , but the same philosophy like <unk> .
would we want that ?
so the next question .
<unk> new companies ?
that 's what we want to do .
we love entrepreneurs and their creative companies .
because we are .
because we talk about the same language .
because we have the same dreams .
because we understand the challenges .
and so we 've got to have a child mortality in the year .
<unk> acid .
and with <unk> , we use creative companies in their development , and we 're using to support people .
and so we 're trying to talk about the participants , entrepreneurs or employees of creative companies with human values .
so the <unk> social policies and <unk> are <unk> .
and <unk> the <unk> .
it 's also <unk> at all .
one more of the child mortality is a different extreme .
he shows a lot of a little bit time where you 're sitting or where you go .
now , you may be fired up .
where you 're willing to be smart , you can think of yourself .
and he looks a bit of what he 's doing .
come up with his strength .
because it 's the creativity that 's even great .
or whether it 's the lentils that you find out .
so the rewards that you ca n't change .
and the power to change things that you can change .
and you can think very much .
it 's very short time .
we know that .
one example .
these are <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
these are five very wonderful women .
with <unk> <unk> and with paper .
it was beautiful , <unk> <unk> for years .
and for years , nothing happened .
because you just did n't have a market .
because they knew how they could be able to make quality quality .
because nobody heard me , the design may be .
we wanted to help these women .
and therefore , in this year , it 's also a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
companies are people from the poverty .
they give them a market .
one future .
we went to the <unk> of our <unk> .
and we begin with a really <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> <unk> of a thousand <unk> of our women .
it 's not just for a year for a year .
but it also allows us to make the project much more different .
and this is the first <unk> of new social media and <unk> .
so if you want to treat people , that 's what you want to do with them , you can also be able to go to the right now .
he can travel around the women ,
in the short term , we do n't want to get five more women or a thousand .
and it 's not just in uganda , but also in a <unk> , where we work together .
but this is just a project that has just a project from our <unk> cycle of projects .
we work in all the field of galaxies .
in the area of <unk> and social and <unk> .
because the work in just a domain is simple .
what happens with children with women ?
right .
this is what we 've done in this year in a year and in uganda , two acres
everything is in our solar cell .
and this whole lot more sense than every single project .
we know , we know , we know , participants in the different projects .
and the <unk> possibilities are still in common .
and finally , i want to leave you in a journey .
and i 'm going to leave you the eyes .
you 're talking about africa .
<unk> in uganda .
you 're sitting in a <unk> space .
and you are satisfied .
you 've been working with your <unk> home .
there was <unk> .
<unk> acid .
<unk> .
the walls are <unk> .
here it 's useful .
you <unk> the window .
and these kids on the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
her <unk> foot <unk> the sand .
you <unk> on your <unk> .
and it 's a thin layer of <unk> .
the kids laugh .
and leave for fun .
you call them that you do n't want to call it anymore .
<unk> acid .
you do n't know how long it is .
but soon you will .
and the <unk> of the day , all the kids were <unk> .
at the end of the street , there is a big tree .
and you 're going to show you guys .
in the bedrooms , in the shadow of the tree , you 'll use the new class of your <unk> .
you 'll always get you with your friends and you .
now , after all of the other women ,
they smile you upwards .
you know , with your <unk> .
on the tree .
in fact .
now , there are incredible internet .
you 're going to leave you with your staff .
you 're looking at it .
the exchange is perceived .
and also , it 's nice to speak again .
you have music .
and the <unk> of <unk> .
ken <unk> <unk> in the courtyard .
she sings a mac song .
you are happy and happy .
you can go to the eyes .
each of us can create the <unk> to a new field .
or at least for a short time , the therapist 's trying to do .
and look what happens .
thank you .
before i started to say , if i was talking about , you know , i 'm talking to you guys that you 've been here , and it 's got a <unk> house .
i 'm not going to do with the lights , but maybe you want someone to do .
so i 'm going to read somebody else .
two .
this is where i do n't know , but in any case here , there are two , it 's beautiful .
i was also doing a building , and the <unk> of the city is <unk> .
this is the building .
so with 18 people , i 'm going to show the <unk> in the last summer of six months .
and so , i 'm going to tell you tonight today .
well , and now some of you may say .
what 's next ?
there 's a lot of them .
but i want to explain it .
well , what did you go ?
and you put them in the park , or how ?
just a little bit of questions about the questions that we have learned , friends , colleagues , when you have to know , that you have to be part of the initiative that i 've been talking about , as a result , i 'm going to have part of the initiative that i have .
all the things that we 've done in the series of <unk> <unk> .
and there were all these <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
and to the <unk> of these orthodoxy .
but you know , i do n't know that this is n't my kind of <unk> .
and it was also the <unk> <unk> of the 1980 .
what we see here is a sign from the <unk> section in <unk> .
this is a public space that 's more successful , and so i do n't think about a lot of people , i 'm not saying , but it ca n't be used to be a public spaces .
we were a group of <unk> windows into the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , memory and sustainable .
and we wanted to tell another group .
we were a <unk> team , and i 've got to look at a little bit , because it was a very <unk> team .
so , in the technological architecture , a social language -- politics -- and <unk> <unk> , statistics , design , status , music and <unk> .
of course , at the same time , in other ways , social media and personal computing .
our <unk> <unk> and savannas .
and also , we 've also done , in other ways , also , in terms of different networks .
and creative size of extraordinary solutions in the <unk> that we 've got to do .
we 've actually sent to get the permissions .
and yet , this is what we 're doing with the stories of stories and ideas .
we asked ourselves in memories and images .
and from these memories , pictures of trying to create ideas from the <unk> .
it 's really important to process the process .
and as a result , we 've been able to do it as a <unk> platform and as a result .
so , a <unk> and a lot of a lot of a lot of a <unk> and a lot of a while .
in the same way we 've done , i 'm going to read today .
every city has <unk> places .
and one of a neighborhood give a face .
in many cases , these technologies were <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of citizens than strangers .
they are the dead place of a city because they do n't often understand what we expect .
so for example , for example , we have superstar <unk> .
now , in fact , you know , but in fact , in fact , in public , the public space , it 's often <unk> .
so , the ones who want their own lives , often often work in the 1960s .
what 's next to do with me , like here , some of you , some of the outside world .
i mean , a lot .
these places are not just a face .
no .
they are the social places in our city , our own life .
so , with all the other things that we use , we have a lot of blood pressure to our neighbors , when we get rid of them .
and can we find these receptors , if we have a smart possibility , and we can actually move when they can also use the spaces .
and we 've managed to save four-fifths .
these are toys .
but what 's useful is a sense of community .
the more i used to do in the public space , and it also means the community .
and if i do n't <unk> me , this is what you call the <unk> of a billion .
we were now two challenges .
we can be at the human consciousness , responsible and grades for their neighborhood , or to <unk> .
how can be used to be developed ?
how can be in the context of ideas ?
<unk> against the <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , but in fact , not the unnamed spaces .
now , imagine that they sit here , first , they read the newspaper and read .
what 's the dominant and the citizens we 've got to do for you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , in fact , you know , you know , you know , for
they can be able to keep on the bottom of the idea of the physical .
and the laws of most of the <unk> will be <unk> .
would you go ?
would anyone like this to this event ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounds kind of fun .
there 's a very simple way of making decisions .
you can <unk> <unk> like this in the future .
and as i said , well , this is a great moment in the first moment .
i 'm trying to tell you an explanation .
and it 's because i think you 're not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do or not , or or <unk> , or <unk> .
first , like a lot of <unk> <unk> often much more .
this is , even though you have n't have a chance to be able to make a lot of good , or the basic alternatives , but there 's also a design , and they 're trying to decide whether they 're <unk> or <unk> in the urban green market .
or , like a friend , first of the color of the fish .
second explanation classic <unk> is rare to information .
think about the three <unk> varieties .
we have what we want to show you , and you can use it .
scientists and <unk> are often the implications of me .
i do n't want to have a decision point of <unk> or <unk> , if i was really smart , i would have to be able to be able to be very <unk> for a lot of time .
it 's also different .
now , despite us , we have a lot of discussion that we 've done a lot of discussion that we 've collected a lot of tricks .
this is what we 've done to experience data , and i want to share for other people .
i want to leave you to other liberties , in other projects , but also , especially in the middle and the government .
because most of the people are able to figure out , and they are responsible for that processes .
now , when we really do the interest in a <unk> , as it 's often , and we 're going to do , and then we need the <unk> new .
now , i do n't get to look at all that you 're sitting here .
and that 's what i 've been doing for very important .
i think it 's important for you all of you , and i want to encourage you with the example of the reasons that you can give you a chance .
and i promise to you , because they are the ones that can take a new <unk> .
so we need to look at the way that we have to look at the human consciousness , responsible and commitment for their neighborhood and <unk> ?
first , for example , on behalf of the dialogue .
and in fact , in fact , <unk> themselves in <unk> , citizens in <unk> and different interests .
what we see here is a test that we have chosen .
what we see here are some <unk> and <unk> in the conversation with men .
so the goal has to be , all of these conversations are based on trial , so that not only the <unk> interests or the <unk> support for the people who are .
the citizens are experts , they are experts , for their neighborhood you know what they 're familiar with a place where it 's a place , and also what they do .
the <unk> , especially in the city , which is to take care of what we 're looking for <unk> .
in investment , in a particular case , there will be a few <unk> , the paths that are on the project , the day .
and all of this leads to a <unk> , where all of the information is all for all the goods and that you can get into the place .
and meanwhile , you can also be able to create a three-dimensional structure .
a conversation based on trial means that the language of the <unk> are actually becoming serious .
and then , if someone says , i want to make a <unk> to the problem .
now , there 's massive <unk> , but the goal has to be done with some audacity with all the time , but perhaps in the <unk> , and perhaps in the <unk> , and maybe in the other place .
as i said , that 's got to come from the dialogue .
second thing is different types of evolution .
our <unk> is <unk> .
one feels ridiculous , when he 's talking about <unk> , or talk .
another woman might be good at this , but it 's not going to talk to a <unk> group .
some other people might be or lifeless .
or take your ideas in <unk> <unk> .
what i want to tell you to do is to be different modes to be different religions .
so what we have here is , for example , you have to think , in this case , what happens .
in the background , a new exhibition .
so we have the opportunity to create <unk> .
we have the opportunity to paint .
we had the opportunity to write .
languages from the age .
this was a <unk> girl .
we had the opportunity to use our ideas with <unk> ideas .
and also , the possibility of being able to interact with <unk> <unk> , should be .
this can happen to an example of this , that can happen to find out of peter .
and the <unk> and the <unk> of the results are using the dialogue .
we have monitored the entire process on facebook , and on a pile of gallons , and at the same time , it 's about <unk> <unk> .
our third thing is <unk> .
now , you may remember that i was thinking about <unk> <unk> .
so in my <unk> , of course , there were three profiles .
<unk> is the process of a while , but it does n't seem to be able to know , and the hidden in the face is not knowing what it 's about is <unk> .
if through the dialogue , and i 'm going to come to the right one , the answer for a locality .
<unk> lie to itself .
and so , if it 's not the case at the beginning of the <unk> , the <unk> of this , and it does n't understand the experiences of the <unk> .
what happens now is that when your <unk> and the city radiates .
it 's already in a way .
i 've got a example of <unk> , which is the <unk> , is probably all over here .
in new york , it was a project , so it 's about a <unk> .
in <unk> <unk> , there 's six months of six weeks ago , who are struggling to decide or at least .
so the time , in the middle school , is not the reforms , as opposed to their own .
and also , the <unk> in new york , which i do n't have to tell you , because he was trying to be one of the most important <unk> of the city .
in the opposite , the <unk> for the <unk> were made .
in <unk> , so , in the back , in germany , we 're back to germany , we have to take the drugs that we can eat from a while .
the city had said , `` it 's not possible .
the four weeks of <unk> that we have made of sync , the rich .
today 's the <unk> of the city .
during the side of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the eaves
so , computers liked their own curves on the road .
in ethiopia , a <unk> <unk> .
all right .
now , we 're just going to take this right now .
but i think it seems to be the city of responsibility .
why ?
for one case , because you have a look for it .
as the blast , the power of the <unk> , or they 're in the form of them in the form of part of the world 's part of the challenge in the form of the challenge , in the way , the city of the responsibility for the same people .
and for other people , when the city is also about the city of projects , other people have to do .
a voluptuous initiative can only use this .
and our goal was to take a bloody initiative that was about 10 years ago , the results and our responsibility to the city .
it 's got the <unk> of the <unk> .
so , you learn a lot .
that 's why we have the problem with which we could n't get the responsibility .
but we know now , when the city is three-fifths to succeed , when the results are actually successful , it will be a <unk> position .
in fact , in the form of the right , it 's still open .
for the end of the time , i 'm sure , a lot of projects , because of these things , complexity , and in their own communities of the city , you have to have the incentive to punish happiness .
if you just have become over time and in the mix with the gods .
in their own city and the citizens .
in each other , you 've got all of you , and you can tell you guys .
if we search for us , if we ascribe to the <unk> of the citizens , we do n't want to be able to be able to be able to do it .
that 's it .
yesterday , in the morning , we went to <unk> in the <unk> , and we were in the <unk> .
we 've heard about <unk> .
so this idea is , however , a second chance to do if it does n't work on this life , and it 's easy to have a great chance .
so we were very exciting .
and we were relatively quickly , and we 've been able to see that there were two things we could n't even go .
so this is one .
the second one is , of course at the end of the same time , was the early time in school , right ?
no one .
no one .
in fact , some of you remember , you know , they were <unk> <unk> .
so i 'm like , now , this is the <unk> years , but the words go to me .
my neck <unk> , and i want to go back to me .
and i did n't know how to me , but in my mind , i was always talking about the <unk> grip , who was always going to me .
no idea of what 's going on .
you 're going to understand it , well , my work was really good , and after i got my last tour behind me , she did n't see .
and what i 'd like to say now , when i 've seen some of the nicest days that i met , i 'm in schools .
it 's a great pleasure and completely transparent .
how did it go ?
how could this happen ?
now , this is a little bit of interest that something happened to me , which i could n't understand .
i got kids .
so , my wife got his children .
and so , of course , it turns out that she was the fact that she was able to do for these <unk> .
and at the time , when she said , honey it is .
and you go .
yes , <unk> .
and so i opened up the door , and then i got this in the <unk> , and i felt invincible in the <unk> .
this just looked like this as well .
and so , of course , in the way , the way that i 've been doing for school , and i 'm going to say , `` well , man here is really unique .
and when i asked the teacher , you know , you do n't know the kids , and i do n't know what the god , i 'm afraid , `` my god , the sentence .
what is that what we 've made out of school , from this case , what is really worth of life ?
so many of us have learned over this right now .
where do they actually have in their lives , right ?
and maybe some other things about the capital of enceladus .
so , what is time for mouths ?
or <unk> , this ability in a lot of time , there 's a little bit more important for me to be able to be able to be able to get myself into a button ?
well , i asked myself for the <unk> , but why ?
and what will be a <unk> doctor , one of a little doctor , and someone wants to be a good doctor ?
so , how is the tenor of the script , or should you be a good face ?
no one .
so , no , for life , not for the school we learn .
if we go to the same time , about 20 years , the middle east , which means that we have .
this is the time in germany in germany .
and in the united states , as we 've done it , its roots has .
and if we could imagine the time , it was so many people we had no access to us .
and there were these four or six years ago that they were forced to go into school , and they were really the only way that they had to learn with the knowledge and the information .
today , a lot of it is more information in his pocket as the largest library of the day .
and in the 19th century , that was the time of the <unk> .
this is , there has been changed in the world , and there were all the people who were able to create these new goals .
but at the same time , however , people need to be able to get those machines .
and we needed people who had these machines to create these machines ,
maybe you can .
so the <unk> foundation that we have today in germany is a wall in this time .
and there 's something done .
anyway , because it was probably really , what i was talking about school , because i was talking to work on the edge , who was working on the screen .
let 's take a look at the future .
let 's look at the <unk> economy , where it is , and look at the year .
the year was the year of the year 's first time i was talking about .
i was done with my work , and i thought , well , you 're going to take you on the first company .
yes , after some of the things i 've been looking at the internet , then i call it up to me .
and some companies are in <unk> , and we 've been so much less and more efficient , and we 've been so slowly , and some of the companies are starting to us back to the back .
you see , in fact , you see two times in life .
and we had 30 thousand years old .
so , we had a beautiful growth , and we had such a lot of jobs on board such <unk> .
i do n't know if you have a wonderful idea , what these people do know when i was in the school , we had no idea that it would be .
even when i was <unk> , i was not talking about the internet .
and the kids that we have to do is at the end of the time that we have to do the job that you 're going to do with 10 , 30 , six or 30 years ?
the only honest answer is , we have no idea .
and what do you know , what do you need to be able to be in these future jobs ?
and if you are honest , the only answer , you have no idea .
and because we 're going to use it in the future , and that could give me the <unk> for the tv .
there 's a <unk> <unk> , read .
well , you can see , you have no idea .
so how do we get out of school , what do you think ?
what are the things we need to spend kids ?
and maybe it looks like a look at what 's going to happen in terms .
that 's the <unk> of school , yes ?
the users of schools and universities come in .
and if you look at a classic classic <unk> , it 's first , you know , what it 's like .
and you want to read , well , the question is that we 're talking about <unk> <unk> , 10 years ago , and about 12 years .
that 's going to be done , and also ca n't afford to do in the future .
but what i can do is to do , is the things that are always important , the things that are <unk> <unk> , and i 'm convinced you to be able to be that the <unk> <unk> of the future .
and you can get into three groups .
so that 's for a company who companies are healthy , so the one is .
now , again , again , all about companies in terms of companies .
and then these companies are dying that are damaged .
so , we 've got to have a robot , and we have .
let 's start with the revenue .
this is relatively quick .
if we look at how economies today today , how fast changes everything is .
<unk> , yes , bringing them up from the internet of today .
and what i think is , i think , because i have hiv who can do with this change .
and what i have to do is that you need to do with this , the creative is .
and what i do is that you have to do is that i need you guys are <unk> .
this is pretty precisely the opposite of what was going on in the factory for 10,000 ships .
and the second thing about the long time , is clear .
it 's about responsibility .
this is what people are doing .
first , for her life .
but also , the whole thing .
whether it 's the company , or as a society we want to take our responsibility for the big .
and the third factor , the <unk> , which is almost unimaginable .
and when we remember the <unk> , then there was the sound of this beautiful .
tagging has <unk> <unk> <unk> , and germany has a team .
it was not the <unk> <unk> who was the best .
that could only build together .
and also , this is what we 're born , and a lot of our time , steve jobs , yes , <unk> .
it was n't the police who had invented the iphone , which did n't copyright the <unk> , who did n't have invented it .
this has a team that was possible for this , because only a team you could do it .
so the school business model that these three things are trying to make this three things that we are learning for .
but there 's still fourth of this , and it 's almost more important .
and that 's all about itself .
if the only thing that we can learn about the future with certainty is that it 's also the ability to work together , and fun for us to experience the knowledge of what we live in the future , and that our children are successful .
so this is a <unk> story , which is what things call it .
but where was i ?
i sat in this <unk> , and the one of you who have kids know that this is not the better term that you have to pay for .
and so , of course , for example , it 's not exactly not any other .
and at the time of the time , in the course of the <unk> , they 're all accepted .
yes , i sat there , and what i 'd like to say , in the <unk> of one of my kids were these <unk> , the <unk> of the event .
a lot of the time , it was for me as a teenager , when i was talking about it , the same thing for me to do about all the time , and learn the whole family .
and more importantly , if the kid is sick , because in aberdeen .
and then , finally , this <unk> or a <unk> of this <unk> program led to this back home .
in fact , it was n't a <unk> , it was kind of like a <unk> , so on the last hour , and in fact , we also have the only parents who had .
and i 'm going to tell you now , and also the details for the time , i think we should have our child , and that 's not .
<unk> , however , two years , where we 've seen , there 's nothing .
what do we do ?
and we got to question the question about our child ?
and are we just the only ones that ?
in fact , i 've been working on the last two years , since i 've seen in the subject of a lot of people , and i found myself , i 'm not talking to you .
there 's a lot of a lot that we have similar , and it was two years ago , there was two years ago , there was a lot of a few years ago , where i was working on the wall , and we sat in the bar , and we sat in the bar , and we were talking about private issues .
and what would we tell me , he 's told us the same story with one of his children , he had almost the same thing as we can , and we 've been so lucky that we could have our kids there .
so in berlin , there 's a <unk> <unk> of different schools , and we can even hook up .
but can that anybody do ?
it 's a little bit about us to take our kids into security , and that moved to what we are .
and after we have the case , school did n't work for us , and we were n't so much , we know , we were the first one that 's happening on the right now .
so , how do we have to think about how hard ?
the good news is that we have acne .
we are not alone .
and we 've done relatively quickly to have a whole lot of the people of what people would like to do , what we wanted to do , what we would like to do , what we would like to do , what we were to do ,
it 's not so much that the kids and your parents have heard about what happens .
if we look at the teachers , 30 percent of the teachers have <unk> .
if we look at how the number of <unk> in the last 10 years has been changed .
can it be all the parents ?
which most of the kids are also , and they also have these teachers .
or whether it 's that we have a solar system that does n't just be able to have a solar system , which does n't just be able to do it as much .
and we 've had a lot of people found that it was like , and we 've had people who had no children .
and they figured out that they need to be responsible for the future , they 're going to have responsibility for the future , by telling the kids and the kids that are now going to school , with the way .
and we have a lot of <unk> design , there 's better about a lot of visual effects that make toast , and there 's almost very high school , and there 's almost a lot of schools that we have to live in .
and there 's even a <unk> or another servant , the <unk> step .
and how should we help ?
we had no idea that we could do now .
but we can do one thing , we can go to these schools , and we can go to these schools , the school , the parents , and the students , and the students , together , and we can make the thousands of benefits .
so , people can work together in the past , so they 've been working on two days , and what it means to work together .
so this is linked to a very important challenge that they solve together .
and after two times , then , for example , we have a new blue-green system , and the <unk> give us to use a new business like us to be in a medical school .
or that have <unk> information for <unk> problems that they have in their school .
within two days , there are only used to be able to see the next day .
but what 's the most important thing is , what 's going on this two days , and that 's what i 'm going to do , with me , i 'm going to take you a little bit of time , and i 'm going to go back to kids in the patient , that 's the energy that i see when the three things .
if the three things together , you know , as it is as primitive .
so what you 're going to think differently is when you live a team .
then this is a syllabary , the <unk> .
and if we took four weeks to this competition , for example , we 've seen that school is as a whole time , the way that we 've done in the united states , to change that there is extraordinary new culture .
and this is incredibly hot .
and i 'm going to think about school as well .
i was reading her to work on school .
and i 'm not talking to yourself about this , to talk about school .
tell you what you 're talking about what you do n't like .
you 'll be surprised how much galvao it will be , and how many people have the same thing , but you can not talk about it .
let 's take it every single school in germany in germany .
let 's change the whole economy .
and let 's take this together with the people who live for school , with the parents , the teachers and the students .
because only together we can do .
thank you .
