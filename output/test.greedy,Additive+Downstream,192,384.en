as steve lopez , i was a steve , and i was going to go to the streets of the center of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , a minister , <unk> , <unk> , who played on a piece of a violin , only two earlier .
many of you will know the story , because of <unk> articles over this , later , later , a book that was <unk> with robert <unk> brothers , which was <unk> , who was <unk> with robert <unk> brothers , which was <unk> , who was <unk> with her <unk> schizophrenia , and whose very promising career appeared in a very short days by his <unk> schizophrenia .
so , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> a <unk> and 30 years later , he lived as a homeless row in the streets of <unk> at the center of the <unk> row at the center of the <unk> row at the center of the <unk> meal at the center of los angeles .
i 'm really positive you to read the story , `` look , '' or looking at the movie so you ca n't understand the wonderful journey between those two men , but also , how the music is creating this connection between those two men , but also , how the music allows this thing , the <unk> , the <unk> burst away from the street .
i met <unk> <unk> in 2008 , two years ago in the <unk> desert hall hall hall , in the short circle , disney ,
he just had a demo of <unk> first and <unk> who heard the stage to introduce me to this .
he spoke to a very drunken and <unk> sound about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton , and about how the dodgers never did n't in the united print , and that all of the sudden my first rib was about <unk> 's conservative symphony .
we came to the topic , and a few days later , i received an email , in the state , that i got to get attention to the <unk> with me .
i still have to mention that i had become a medical treatment for him , because he was already with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , which was treated in his life .
so as a result , it 's now consolidated to these molten communities , and they 're sometimes so bad , and he 's awake in the streets of <unk> 's ninth , and that he was <unk> and the <unk> of his own spirit .
and in fact , this was a <unk> , when we first had the first pair of subjects in the <unk> desert tanks , and he had this persistent <unk> in his eye and a completely lost .
he talked about invisible leaders and smoke and about how someone would poison poison in their sleep .
i had scared , not so , but i had scared that he could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
so i started to play .
i was playing the first sentence by <unk> <unk> .
and as i was playing , i fell on that , in a sense , i fell up with a full change on the ground .
it was like he stood under the impact of an invisible drug , a chemical reaction whose was going to become my game .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and she draws into a quiet curiosity and a tension .
and as a miracle took his own head , and then , after some snippets of <unk> , and asked them to play with them , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we then then started talking about music , starting to talk about the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , all the other guys , from <unk> to <unk> .
and i realized that he 's not just a <unk> knowledge of music , but he also had a close personal relationship with it .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding that i was only just by my colleague in the crash of los angeles .
by looking at music , and about music was from this <unk> , ritual man , who was only going through the streets of los angeles , and was a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
music is medicine . it 's changed us .
for <unk> , music means music .
because the music allows him to his thoughts and delusions of his imagination and creativity in something real .
and so he <unk> his <unk> .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
and that 's why we make music : so we 're doing something that we do , that we can do something that 's in all of us , and our emotions , through our artistic lens , through our creativity of reality .
and the reality is that we all know about us , and move , and move , and we 're inspired to us .
what <unk> does is that he took his music back to a community of friends .
the <unk> force opened him back to a family of musicians who understood his talent and it was something like to me .
and i 'm going to play again with shocking music , no matter of the <unk> salon in the <unk> , or in <unk> , because he remembered me why i have become musicians .
thank you very much .
bruno giussani : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something i 'm going to stolen the <unk> .
i hope you excuse me .
so i 've got lots of fish in my life .
i only loved two loved .
and that first , that 's more like a passionate scientist .
it was a nice fish , <unk> , good use , <unk> , a <unk> on the menu .
and you can see what a fish .
even better , it was going to be inspired by the most famous of the <unk> of the sustainability .
so you could think about it , you know , sell him .
i had a relationship with a number of months .
one day , the ceo , the company , and asked if i could say , at one event , i could say the sustainability of the farm .
of course , i said .
here was a company that was trying to figure out what this kind of needs problem is to improve , how do we keep getting a fish on our <unk> ?
over the last 50 years , we 've downloaded the ocean leaders as we 've collected forests .
it 's hard to <unk> the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish , the one who we love , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , they have collapsed .
it 's almost nothing left .
so i think , `` bad <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
many arguments about this . <unk> infections the environment that most of you are anyway , and they 're inefficient , and it 's inefficient , and it 's a big disadvantage .
he has a cassette from 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of water , so you need to get a pound .
not very deeply .
not so much good .
so here , finally , a company was tried to make it right .
i wanted to supported it up .
the day before the event , i called the head of the ministry of the company .
let 's call it to the war .
`` rosy , '' i said , `` just to have the facts right out of the sea , you 're famous for that , so that 's out of the ocean that you 're not going to be in the ocean . ''
`` that 's true , '' he said , `` we 're so far out of the waste of our fish , not concentrated . ''
and then he put it , `` we 're basically a very different world .
and this <unk> of video game has to 1 , he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
one , amazing .
`` dig one thing ? what do you do ? ''
`` sustainable proteins , '' he said .
`` great , '' i said . put on .
and at that evening , i was in bed and thought , what about hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , shortly before the event , i call to get started .
i said , `` well , what can you have to proteins ? ''
he said he does n't know . he 'll be following .
well , i 'm <unk> with a couple of people in the company . nobody could give me an answer for me to get with the eighth biologist .
we call it a lot of war .
`` welcome , '' i said , `` what 's sustainable proteins ? ''
well , he 's called some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , `` <unk> . ''
i said , `` pardon ? ''
he said , `` yes , bang , skin , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . ''
i said , `` how much percent of the <unk> is chicken ? ''
in fact , maybe two percent .
`` well , that 's about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , `` well , what 's useful to provide chicken ? ''
there was a long time in the line , and he said , `` there 's just a lot of chicken phone around the world . ''
i 'm <unk> myself from this fish .
no , not , because i 'm a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that 's me .
no , i 've got <unk> in a fish that 's because of this fish , because , i swear to god , who 's got to chicken after chicken .
that second fish , that 's another kind of <unk> .
it 's the romantic way to know , the better you learn to your fish , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
i first eaten it in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> journalist had spoken for a long time ago .
it has <unk> us with us .
he came up with a light , almost white color .
the pc chef had <unk> him .
shut twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can taste a fish so good after he was born ?
i ca n't , but this guy can .
let 's call it a miguel job , actually , he 's miguel .
and no , he does n't have the fish up , and it 's not a chef . at least , the way that they understand .
he 's a biologist with <unk> <unk> .
this is a <unk> touch-screen <unk> in the <unk> .
it 's close to the <unk> of the river river .
until the 1980s was the farm to the hands of the <unk> .
they were <unk> <unk> on what they were in the wetlands .
they made it by giving the country .
they built it into the complex of marine , and they were pushing water from the land and they 're looking into the river .
well , they could n't make that , that was , in fact , not so economically .
and it was a catastrophe .
it took about 90 percent of the birds to what 's a lot of birds .
and so , a spanish company is called the land .
what did they do ?
they have the river of the water 's river .
they literally have the ability to buy the practice .
instead of doing the water , you used the channels back to the water again .
they are the channels .
they created a <unk> of <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , a <unk> -- and then we have a <unk> of the ecological destruction completely the other way .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you 've never seen this thing .
they 're looking out on the horizon that 's a million miles away , and everything you see are <unk> channels and <unk> , <unk> march .
i was n't a long time there , a lot of time .
he 's a gorgeous guy , three parts of charles darwin and one part `` a crocodile . ''
okay ? there we were and struggled to the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , and i put it on my knees and miguel objectives to my knees .
here he <unk> a rare <unk> .
now he started talking about the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , he 's looking at a pattern of <unk> that reminded him to the <unk> .
it turns out that it 's a vast part of his career in the <unk> national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national
i asked him how to become a <unk> .
he said , `` no ? i know nothing about fish .
i 'm an expert for relationships . ''
and then it goes and sustaining in more sensitive birds and algae and funny .
and understanding me , no way that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community , the way in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was turned out of this <unk> piece of delicious fish that i had on the <unk> .
so i was called it . i said , `` daddy , what is your fish so good so ? ''
he showed up the algae .
`` i know , the algae , the relationships , the relationships , that 's incredible .
but what do you eat ?
what is the <unk> ? ''
well , he 's looking at me to tell me that it 's such a collective system , that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
the profits 's <unk> biomass , the food , the <unk> , that 's what the fish is doing .
the system is so healthy , it 's totally incorrect .
there 's no food .
the one of a farm is n't you ?
and then i went back to the site , on this site , i was looking around the site , and i asked him , `` for a place that 's like , of course , to be so , '' unlike any farm i ever ever had , `` how do you know ? ''
the moment was that a <unk> would have been intended to a <unk> .
and we bow around the corner and we offered the great picture , thousands of and thousands of fellow organisms , a literally vivid carpet , so far as it is enough .
`` that 's success , '' he said .
`` look at the <unk> , pink .
she <unk> . ''
telegraph ? i was totally disturbed .
i said , `` `` i 'm `` finance , do n't you have your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> .
now last year , on this site , the largest birds , more than 250 different kinds of species were .
it 's today that the largest thing today is now has gone from one of the major private investment in europe .
i said , `` miguel , is a good business problem you want to have a <unk> . ''
he gets his head , no .
he said , `` we 're building <unk> , not hard .
this is a piece of a piece of the system .
the aggregate people are calling the <unk> .
the secular eat the food system .
so the truth of the stick the better system in the system . ''
okay , let 's think this , a farm that does n't sit down , and a farm that 's your success of their <unk> .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , the point of the <unk> should not even be there .
they 're <unk> , in a city of <unk> miles away , where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning they fly out to 20 miles per square .
and every night they fly over 54 miles .
they 're doing that because you can retrace the <unk> white line from the highway pool .
seriously .
i had a kind of journey from penguins , so i looked forward .
i said , `` miguel , fly away from the square and fly yellow miles back ?
do you do that for the children ? ''
and he looked like me as i 'd have been watching a song by providence .
he said , `` no . you do that because the food is better . ''
i did n't know the skin of my beloved , the <unk> was delicious , and i do n't like <unk> . i do n't like it .
it 's this <unk> , <unk> flavor .
i just like to do it with it .
and yet , when i did n't expect them in this restaurant , it 's not <unk> <unk> .
and they liked sound and in a position of the ocean .
i mentioned it against miguel and it 's using .
he said , `` the skin seems a <unk> .
it 's the last one before something in the body was happening .
she 's designed by evolution to <unk> <unk> . ''
and then he put it , `` but our water has no <unk> . ''
okay . one farm that does n't ask her , a farm that measures their success at the success of their birth .
and then i realized when he says a farm that has no <unk> , <unk> it , <unk> it , <unk> it , <unk> it , <unk> it through the river river in the river .
it 's a river that 's all the things that are now , where rivers technologies have to be , to lead them to the chemical pollutants , chemical pollutants , from <unk> .
and when it 's done by the system , and this is what it 's warmer , as it is <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so , not just a farm that does n't give their animals to do it a farm that 's literally a <unk> , and not just for those fish , but also for you and me .
because when the water goes off , it <unk> in the atlantic .
a drop of the ocean , i know , but i take him , and i embrace it , because these are the <unk> that i 'm going to do , because these are the <unk> brothers , so they 're also <unk> .
you might say that they 're a recipe for the future , whether we 're talking about mysticism or <unk> .
what we need is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one of a sudden , in the food , in fact , in the food , in fact , that food is good .
but for many people , that 's a little too radical .
we 're not luxuries , we 're <unk> . we 're lover .
we love eye-popping . we love little <unk> . we talk about regional food . we eat more organic .
and if you claim that things are the future , someone else goes somewhere on and say , `` hey , people , i love pink flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? ''
can i be honest ?
i do n't like that question .
no , not , because we 're producing enough calories to feed the world more than just feed .
one billion people will be sending today .
a billion -- this is more than ever before , because of <unk> trends in the distribution , not the <unk> .
well , i like this question , because it has the logic of our <unk> that 's about the last 50 years .
take grain of grain , <unk> on <unk> , chemicals on the earth , and the whole time has the exo ' disease , `` if we feed more people , how bad can we be ? ''
this was the <unk> . it was the place . it was the u.n. director of the american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a game in <unk> , a stakeholder , which is what fast is about , which is the production of production .
that 's not a role , and it 's not agriculture .
our <unk> rely on today is not based on <unk> <unk> , but because of <unk> resources .
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through a country , not by replacing , but through the <unk> of the forests , and not through both of the forests and nets , and by fish in the ocean .
you want to feed the world ?
let 's start with the question : how are we feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that enable us to feed themselves ?
to do that , do n't look at the <unk> of the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and machines and machines are <unk> in the world , and it 's never going to get something really good for food .
let 's take a look at the environmental model .
that 's what runs on two billion years .
take a little bit like a <unk> , a lot like miguel .
businesses that are n't really <unk> , the way rather than stewards , the <unk> or the <unk> , the more expensive , the more expensive , the more expensive , the more expensive , the more expensive , the more expensive , the more expensive , the more expensive , the more expensive , the more expensive , the more expensive , the more expensive , the more expensive , the more expensive , the more expensive , the more expensive , the more expensive , the
because they are the people who are experts with the experts .
and if i really become honest , they 're a better chef than i 'm going to be .
you know , that 's right , because if the future of good food is to be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to convey one thing today , it 's the whole of the data that we consume , bigger than the sum of the pieces and instead of thinking of creating a way of thinking , i want to think about how to use information , that they can think of how to use information , that they can be thinking about how to use information , that they can be in the way that we can use to how to use information , that they can be visible , and we can see that they were n't visible .
so , what we 're seeing here is a typical <unk> pavilion .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it 's what i can do with sub-orbital data is that i can filter the self in a certain , mutually driver 's seat , we 're going to be accidents .
and immediately , i see another pattern that makes you feel like .
and that 's because of the <unk> here , the people are being on the <unk> and they 're on the end over the road .
we can continue one step further and start that data , and we see that <unk> and cancer is the common suspects , but not for everybody .
so , if we go further and go to age , we 're going to say 40 years or younger we have to see that human beings should be concerned about people .
and who 's seen that this is particularly about men .
so what you see is that the view of information and data is very <unk> in a form of knowledge .
and if we do this for wireless wireless , why do n't we have any content themselves ?
what we have here are the most popular people here are any of the <unk> of any single charity that were ever been published .
it 's all right here . it 's all online .
you can test it to my talk .
you can get used to a decade .
they can get into a certain year .
you can jump to a certain extent .
now , if i look at here , i see the dials that appear in this video , and the rabbit i kind of flipped .
i 'm a <unk> counter , so i 'll get this sort of what i call you all to show me in the interim of armstrong .
now , if i just want to get a <unk> of this , i could think , `` okay , what if i 'm going to see everything else with this subject ? ''
so i 'm going to go back and <unk> the perspective .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get a sense of that , if you put on these kinds of information , you 're <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you 're not just or not just a pessimistic system .
you make something that 's actually a little bit different .
it 's something in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i want to take this idea a little bit further with something a little bit crazy .
what we 've done here is we took every single <unk> and they reduce it on a small little .
and the story contains a short and a symbol for the space you come .
i 'll just show the top 500 of the <unk> <unk> .
but even in that point , we can do a lot of things .
we 're going to get a sense of the things that are the most of wikipedia at the high of the most of the most popular .
i 'm going to choose the subject .
now , after i took the <unk> ' elected , i know , the <unk> that are most of the most of the report reveal for the first time , `` people 's going '' ''
this is really important , because this is one of a insight which is not in a single <unk> .
this is just one of the one that 's just a step up when you start to go back , and all of it looks like .
it 's a certain one point of this cartoon map , and i can think about the theme of the year , and everybody together .
now , if i know all these people , i know the majority of these are <unk> . some of them come from the science . some of them are still out of the science . there 's my boss . and one comes from the <unk> .
interestingly , a ted prize is a ted prize winner .
so we can jump on a minute to every ted prize winner .
you can see , we 're surfing on the web , the first time it 's a net , not just one , but a lot more abstract .
and so i want to tell you what else might be a little surprise .
i 'm just showing you the new york times website .
well , what you can do is this application -- i do n't want to call it a browser ; it 's not browser , but you can look at this <unk> to every single website like this .
so i can go back to a specific <unk> .
that 's why it 's so important , because it 's just a way that you can look at the same thing in this way , that 's going to look at the same thing in the same way .
so i can zoom in a certain way of this sort of quickly .
here 's the state of the entire demonstration i 've been thought .
and i can look at what i 've been looking at today , again , again .
and then , when i was standing back to a step up and i can do everything , i may have a lot of time to my <unk> , and here , i think , i was looking for <unk> , you know , to get round of it , or here to live with live .
and from here i can come in the page and go back .
it 's a metaphor that 's used again , and every time it makes the g20 as the sum of the <unk> .
and the moment in this world is that data is a curse .
we 're talking about the oscar of the <unk> .
we 're talking about `` stop in information . ''
what if we could turn that situation and the internet on the top , so we always have to go from one to the other things , and you can see the patterns that otherwise otherwise else ?
if we can do this , then these things are going to be <unk> , maybe a new source of length of that .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can actually know .
and when we learn to know , we can actually make the <unk> .
so i 'm hearing with that , thank you very much .
i grew up with a <unk> of science fiction fiction fiction fiction .
in my school i went to school with the bus , every day , an hour .
and my nose was always in a book , a <unk> , which my thoughts was <unk> in other worlds , and on a <unk> way of my heart , i think , incredibly frightening curiosity .
and this curiosity , i always showed that if i was n't in high school , i went through the forests of the forests , and the <unk> and the <unk> and beetle and beetles and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and
i was totally totally stimulated , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and the limitations of the possible subject .
and my love of science fiction fiction is in my surroundings , because then when the late '60s , we flew on the moon , and we flew out of the deep sea .
jacques <unk> came in our living room to prepare us and places and a world full of wonder we had never had .
and so then you 'd have this <unk> of those <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint paint .
and there 's no video games else that <unk> with me now film the whole picture in the landscape , i had to create the pictures of my head .
we had to all the time all these things . so if we were to read a book , we took the description of the <unk> and we would have the screen into the screen .
my response to that was just a painting and paint from aliens , the worlds , robots , and all that .
in an act of an act , i was constantly going to get the teacher , like i was using the dirty field , <unk> .
the creativity had somehow somehow get out of it .
and what happened something happened to me was about jacques <unk> , which was the idea of a completely unfamiliar world on earth .
certainly i would never reach a aliens to the <unk> world , which was pretty unlikely .
but here , one world i could actually hit in the earth , and she was as fascinating and exotic , like all this , what i had imagined when i was trying to read these books .
so i decided to get her to become a 15 percent .
the only problem in a small problem was that i lived in canada , a half of the next ocean removed .
i did n't let me <unk> .
i <unk> my dad until he finally had a <unk> in a timeline , new york , made , was just on the other side of where we lived .
i was doing my kickstarter in a pool of <unk> in the winter in the winter in the winter , new york .
the ocean , but it 's the real ocean , only two years later , when we went to california .
since the 40 years , we have spent about three hours of water , 500 hours of that in <unk> .
and i learned that the world of the deep deep , even in the most vulnerable ocean , so rich in life is so rich , as we can really imagine it .
the hearing of nature does not know the boundaries , regardless of our own , human imagination .
until the present day , i 'm really proud of awe for what i see on my side of the time .
and my love to the ocean is taking the same intensity of the ocean and the way the rest of the world .
when i was an adult encountering a job , it was the most talkative .
it seemed to be the best way to come up to tell me , to tell stories with my need to create pictures .
and as a child , i was reading the zoning and the way i was reading it .
so , movies were the way , images and stories , and that fit together .
of course , the stories i 'm passing out of the <unk> , `` `` the `` terminator , '' and `` the `` the `` pc . ''
in `` the `` dream '' i could make my <unk> for the <unk> and the <unk> .
so my two loves my two passions .
something interesting happened in this movie -- and that 's what we had to create a kind of liquid <unk> , and we 'd get to get up to a <unk> , ooh , back .
and what came out is the first sighting that was going to see in a movie .
the film did n't put a money , he just said , he just got his software system , but i realized something fascinating : the audience around the world was <unk> of the magic , the one of it .
according to arthur <unk> , the world 's law are more powerful technology , and therefore no longer from any other .
so you saw something magical .
and that was what i found was exciting .
and i thought , `` wow , that must be really going to be in the <unk> . ''
so we went to `` `` the `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` ``
together with <unk> , we put on the guy from liquid metal , and the success was placed out of this , how this effect would come .
and it worked . again , we had something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same thing , but we have a little bit more money on the film .
and from these two experiences , a whole new world was reached a whole new world of creativity .
so i started a company with my brilliant friend of dodo , who was the best <unk> , and <unk> was a `` digital skies . ''
the concept of this organization was the stage of marine processes with visual <unk> and the same with the digital <unk> .
and that 's what we did , and then we get a conscious spot .
but in the 1990s , we discovered that we had the <unk> and <unk> -- what we were actually started to do -- to slow up to slow .
i had this piece `` `` avatar , '' which was the sort of visual effects and <unk> effects in all new heights of the human , the longest characters that were made by the protected , and the <unk> should all be the whole plain and the world should be .
but the wild love is very , back , and people in my company told me that we do n't be able to create that .
so i did this , and i made this other movie above the big ship , the hood .
i 'd sell this as `` the purpose and juliet on a ship , '' it was sold a <unk> <unk> , a greek film .
but i wanted to give the real ticket of the titanic .
so i did the movie .
that 's the truth . the studio did n't .
but i convinced them , by saying , `` we 're pulling up to the train . we 're going to go to the real house .
we 're going to show it in the <unk> of the movie .
that 's beautiful . it 's a good news for marketing . ''
and i 'm assuming you an expedition to finance .
sounds crazy . but that 's back to the back to that your imagination can create a reality .
we then then , six months later , a reality where i was living in a russian nazi university , four miles below the surface of the sahara atlantic , and i was making the real-life titanic through a <unk> .
this was not a movie , no such , that was real .
so that 's really blew me .
and the amount of it was extraordinary . we had to build cameras and speed and everything .
and i fell on , like , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
you go into this mountain , you 're going to push into this dark , hostile environment , where no hope is to rescue , if you do n't go back to it .
and i thought , `` wow , that 's just as if i was in a <unk> .
that 's really cool . ''
i was obsessed with study the deep sea .
anyway , from the part , with curiosity and science , it was all . it was , it was like , it was like , it was like , it was .
and it was a humbling that was n't going to give me hollywood to .
because , you know , i could think of a creature that we could make visual worlds , but i could n't show you what i would see outside of the <unk> .
and some of the previous principles i 've seen is in the art of <unk> , and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things before , and that 's the science to the point when we saw them , sometimes things that i saw , sometimes i had no words ,
so this has come to me right , and i wanted to .
and so i met a little unusual choice .
after the success of the country , i said , `` okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker , hollywood to hollywood on ice and i 'll be <unk> for a while . ''
and then we started to go and started to say , we arrived to the `` dune , '' and we did it with <unk> .
we went to the flight of the titanic .
we took little little robot that we were built , which was a <unk> device .
our intention was to look at the inside of the ship , which never had done before .
nobody had the inside of the <unk> . you have n't no longer a way . so we developed the technology .
so , i 'm sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see the <unk> that i know , that once she played the band .
and i just fly along with a little tour through the corridors of the ship .
i 'm actually suggesting it , but my mind is within the inside .
it felt like i was physically inside the initiation center within the heart of the titanic .
that was the specifications of a <unk> , which i ever had , because before i had a corner , i knew what would be the same in the <unk> of the object , because i was going to go back to the <unk> , and i was going to go back to the movie when we did the movie .
and the set of it was a really replica of the box of the ship .
so that was a highly strange experience .
and she made me realize that they 're using this <unk> template and so that their awareness in the vehicle , in which other forms of existence .
it was really quite profound .
and maybe a little bit smaller , maybe what might happen in some decades , if you have <unk> , to explore something or other things , in all sorts of <unk> that i can think of as a <unk> .
after that , we began what we saw at the bottom , really appreciate , for example , this <unk> of the face of the face of the face , but here on earth .
they 're living with a help of themselves .
they 're not alone , as we do that .
and so you can see animals that will be right next to the next one , right next to 500 degrees c , that they can survive .
and at the same time , i was also interested in a while that was the <unk> of my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who care for space and the nasa and the nasa have been sitting in and the <unk> and the right market planning , and you drive to russia , go on the mission of the <unk> trading , and it 's like , and they 're taking our <unk> .
that was amazing .
but at the end , it was going on , and i took us to the deep deep ocean .
i took them up with and <unk> them to the world , like , <unk> , <unk> , people who were interested in the extreme environments , so i took them to the sources of the sources of the sources of the sources of the sources of the sources of the sources of the sources of the sources of the sources of the sources of the world , so they would take the sources of the sources of the world , so they would take samples and instruments and so forth .
we used to have been around , but we did science , in more , more .
so the result between my existence as a <unk> , the <unk> , and the bigger in reality is in reality .
and in the course of that , i have learned a lot of learned .
i 've learned a lot about science , but i now think you 're certainly , a director has to be a director like a stairmaster or something like that .
but i did n't understand much of leadership before i <unk> this <unk> .
because , in a certain point , i had to say , `` what do i do here ?
why do i do this ? what is going out ? ''
this is movies , do n't make us money .
we just play the creation . there 's no rocket lift .
all think i think of `` titanic , '' and `` avatar , '' and i would have a cut on a piece of a piece of the beach .
i 've all made those films , this is a very small audience .
no reference , no honor , no money , what are you doing ?
you 're doing it to be the challenge , the challenge , the ocean is the <unk> environment that are there , you are doing it the judgment of , and because of the strange connections that comes when a little group of people make a team .
because we 've done this with just 10 to 12 people that have been done for years , and sometimes we were two to three months on the ocean .
and in this community , you can notice the most important thing that you have , because you have a task that you can explain to any other .
if you had to land on land , and you had to do it , the rate , the <unk> , and all the difficulty that the whole technology , when you 're on the ocean , you ca n't explain the other way , which is like police or in soldier , that you can never explain to it .
there 's a connection that creates a connection , a more powerful respect .
so when i came back to turn my next movie `` avatar , '' i tried to apply the same cancer system , which is that you have to use the team and you would have a respect in the comparison .
and so the dynamics became really changed .
so , i got another team on the <unk> terrain , and we used to be `` solomon '' with a new technique that was n't there .
it 's exciting .
a huge challenge .
and we were going to have a period of a <unk> of a <unk> family .
and so , in fact , my way to make movies , completely .
there was people who thought we would have been doing this epidemic , really , and they 're transported to the planet .
for me , it was more than me , more than my job , who changed the actual process , and that changed .
so what can we close from all of that ?
what ? lessons have we learned ?
i think of first , the curiosity .
it 's the most powerful human quality .
and our imagination is a force that actually can make a reality .
and the second of your team is more important than all of the world 's world 's top of the world .
i come to me , young news saying , `` give me a advice like i can do something . ''
and i say , `` do n't you have a difference .
they 're getting another thing . do n't make you not bet you , you bet yourself . they take risks on you . ''
nasa has this <unk> , `` no matter is not an option . ''
but in art , and in art , in art , in art , and study it has to be an alternative , because there 's a long-term plan .
not an important thing , the innovation , the innovation , was n't thinking about it .
you have to be ready to take this risks .
that 's the idea i want to give you to the way to the road . it 's really an alternative , fear but is n't . thank you .
today , i 'm talking about energy and climate .
and that 's surprising , because my favorite career at the foundation mainly about <unk> <unk> and seed , to make the things that we create and provide to make better lives .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , that 's exactly more important for these people , that 's exactly more important for every other on the planet .
<unk> means that their three years is not growing over many years . it 's a lot of it or too low , but things that are going to do so to change it can not withstand her <unk> environment .
this leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , a change is really terrible for you .
and also the problem of it is to make it very important .
in fact , if you could reduce one of the price to the <unk> , it would be a energy at the most effective .
well , the <unk> <unk> is the time time .
indeed , the <unk> on the <unk> .
the <unk> people were the industrial revolution in the world , and even in the 20th century , there was a <unk> case in the <unk> , and so we have <unk> , air machines , we can create modern materials and so many things .
so we 're in a wonderful situation with power in the wealthy world .
but if we reduce the price -- let 's make it a price down to a new barrier , and this barrier is based on carbon dioxide .
co2 is the planet and the <unk> of co2 is actually quite clear .
they 're <unk> the <unk> co2 , which is leading to the <unk> , and this <unk> has a number of very negative , and so effects on the weather and maybe worse , that the natural ecosystems can not perceive , and therefore , whole systems .
well , the exact area of the <unk> and the <unk> that you have to look , there 's some <unk> , but not very many .
and there 's certain more bad about how bad these are , but they 're extremely bad .
i asked the <unk> several times , `` do we really have to get close to close to zero ?
do n't you have to get away or a quarter ? ''
the answer is , as we get close to zero , the temperature will continue to rise to the rise .
so , that 's the big challenge .
it 's very different from saying , we have a explosive m of high truck under a three meter bridge . it 's like you 're going to get it underneath .
this is a very thing , right to zero .
well , we 're going to run a lot of <unk> , over 26,000 billion tons .
each single american tons of tons , people from poor countries , less than one .
in the average , it 's about five tons for every on the planet .
and somehow we have to be able to get that down to zero .
it 's so far at a time .
it 's only different economic changes that we have to go to the world , and we have to go to the people and to go to zero .
and this equation has four factors . it 's a little bit of <unk> . they have this thing on the left -- carbon -- it 's going on to zero , which they want to get zero to zero , and that will depend on the number of people , from the service , from the service , the average energy for every service and the co2 that every human is in average , the average energy for every service and the co2 , which is the average energy for every service and the co2 , which is the <unk> <unk> .
so let 's look at each of them , and we think about how we 're going to get this on zero .
probably one of those numbers have to get very close to zero .
now this is basically an intimate breast , but let 's go .
we have the population .
today , today , today , is now 6.8 billion people .
and it 's starting to be 9 billion to move 9 billion .
if we could succeed , we could think about 10 percent to 15 percent , but the time we see a slope of 1.3 .
the second factor is the services that we use .
this is all the food we eat , clothing , television , heating .
these are very good things and <unk> meaning , that services to almost make the available services .
it 's great that this number is going up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could make it <unk> and less , but in the average , that number of every year and then again , more than double , the number of services services are the per person per person .
here 's a very serious service . there 's a very <unk> service , so you can read the homework ?
and these students do n't have , so they 're reading their <unk> underneath the algerian .
well , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there 's good news .
we have something that 's not going to be .
because of different successes in the world , in other <unk> , through new methods , there are many employees that have been happening , their energy share , are spending 90 percent of the ground .
in other , like the manufacturing creation , <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or <unk> , or <unk> , is the sharing of improvement , much smaller .
so , in all , if we 're optimistic , we might think about a factor of three or maybe even another .
but the first three factors , we have now <unk> 13 billion tons , and it 's just not enough .
so let 's take the fourth factor -- and this will be a <unk> -- that 's the amount of co2 that 's going to be a <unk> .
it turns out the question is if you can get this on zero .
if you burn out of coal , you do n't .
if you burn the natural gas , you do n't .
nearly every single generation of current , it 's <unk> co2 , except renewables and <unk> .
so , what we need to do is to do a global level , is a new paradigm .
we need collusion .
if i do use the word `` wonders '' i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , `` wonders . ''
the aggregate is a wonder . the computer is a wonder .
the web and the services , it 's a wonder .
people here are contributed to many of these wonders .
normally there is no such thing that you need a miracles to a certain date .
it 's normally that you 're just going to be just walking and some of them , other people .
in this case , we have to give up and a miracle in a very short time .
now , i wondered , how do i really <unk> this ?
is there a natural , is one demonstration that people are on the idea of people here ?
i remembered that last year , when i took them to pull together , and somehow people who were .
the idea was that they really start to know , you know , that there are people who are living with these sorts of people who are living with them .
and for energy , i noticed this .
i decided that the stereotype of <unk> was my <unk> 's contribution to the environment .
so here are some natural religious .
you have told me that you do n't bite me . in fact , they do n't even leave the glass .
well , there 's all sorts of things like this , but not all of you do n't .
we need solutions to have a large scale and some kind of <unk> , and even though there 's many directions that people look at , i really only have five to make these big needs to make this big need .
i have some admired , <unk> , beat and boxes .
now , maybe maybe a long piece of time , and if you do better than i expect , that would be the awesome , but my halo here is that we have to work on all of those five problems , and we ca n't give them from them because they have some serious issues .
let 's look at the burning of fossil fuels , burning of either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do is , maybe , you know , it 's not . you have to all of the carbon that would burn out of the way that you have to burn out of the carbon dioxide , you know , under pressure , grab out of pressure , grab the pressure out there and you hope that there is one there .
there 's a few of them who are getting on a 60 percent -- 80 percent globally , but it 's getting a lot of 100 percent , and it 's really difficult to get the <unk> of the plant of the carbon , is a very difficult challenge . but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who will make it ?
who can assure something a little guarantee , what is literally a lot of a crap that you can think of yourself and other things ?
that 's a lot of small .
so this is a tough <unk> .
next next , clubbing .
they also have the three big problems . the cost , especially in <unk> countries , are highly , very , in fact , the question is that you really feel that nothing can be wrong , despite the human part that the fuel is not being done for weapons .
and then , what do you do with the garbage ?
even though he 's not very high , there 's a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that are solvable , and they should be working on .
the last three of the five of the five is i 've been in .
it 's the renewables , you 're called a lot of people 's disease .
and also they have -- though it 's great that you do n't need any fuel -- they have some downsides .
one is the <unk> that these technologies are generating dramatically less than the <unk> .
these are nukaks , you 've spoken by many <unk> , a thousand times more area than a normal power .
and then these sources are the world 's population .
the sun shines , not all day , it does n't seem to be a day and the winds do n't get it all the time .
so you have to have a way to get one of the energy , but in times if they 're not available .
so there 's a big <unk> . there are challenges in transmission . if we 're saying that the energy energy emissions outside the country is , they do n't need the technology , you have to deal with the risk that the energy from where it comes from .
and there 's the <unk> .
and to show the dimension , i have all sorts of batteries that are made , the <unk> , the ones , the computer , cell phones , cell phones , cell phones , cell phones , the amount of the world , and that 's what i 'm producing now , that all the batteries we produce , less than 10 minutes of the stock stock store .
so we need a big breakthrough , something that 's going to be a factor of 100 times a factor of 100 , than the time time .
that 's not impossible , but it 's not so easy .
this is what happens when you try to get these <unk> sources over 20 percent -- 30 percent of the rest of the rest .
if you want to be 100 percent of it , you need an incredible amount of sand .
now , where should we go , what 's the right approach ?
a google project , and how come to target ?
what we need is many companies that work on this . hundreds of them are .
in each of these five sectors , we need to be at least 100 people .
so , you know , they 're nuts . that 's good .
i think in the ted group there are many of them who are already there .
bill big has a number of companies under other things called the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens companies have amazing stuff and interesting possibility and i try to support that .
nathan myhrvold and i will support a company that maybe maybe the nuclear approach .
there 's some major health in the <unk> ; it 's solvable , liquid .
development has gone in this industry , some time , so it 's not great surprise that some good concepts have been dancing .
the <unk> means that you 're not on a part of the <unk> , which is one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the hunter-gatherer .
that 's a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you 've been thinking about it , but you could never be able to do that , but you could never have the idea of that it was modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , and you 'll see that , yes , with the correct market , it 's like this .
and because you burn this 99 percent , it 's a lot better than better .
in fact , you burn the garbage , and you can even use the waste of today , and you can use the waste of today , you can use the waste of today .
instead of looking at it , you burn it . it 's a great thing .
the <unk> is getting rid of a candle , a little bit like a candle .
you can see that it 's a sort of a column , often as `` the `` blinding wave of the web . ''
and this is what they really do .
here 's a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent , you have the part that 's now burned today , so it 's <unk> uranium .
that 's the <unk> u.s. u.s. for hundreds of thousands of years .
and when you 're manageable , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there 's many challenges , but it 's an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
think about how to measure our success .
how would our strategy look like ?
now , let 's go to the target we need to get to a meeting and we talk about the <unk> .
many talk about a 80 percent of the risk by 2050 .
it 's really very important that we get there .
the rest 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and hopefully will be <unk> and cement to be clean .
so to reach these 80 percent , the world , including countries like china , their <unk> completely .
the other note , it says , is if we 're using the most advanced technology , whether they 're in all developed countries , and we 're on the road to get them to the rest .
that 's great importance .
this is what it 's going to be in the game of this <unk> .
if we go back to go back , what should the evidence look like ?
it 's going to contain the two elements .
we should use the programming to take the reduction on the road , the less we <unk> , the less less will be the <unk> and the temperature .
but actually , this note is the things we 're making businesses , just in the big microwave background , just in the same way , or even something much less important as the people who 's the basis of innovation to this lovely society .
this is a recent subject to track us with <unk> control , and we can measure them , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there 's a great writing of this topic .
al gore 's `` we have choice , '' and david <unk> , `` the <unk> , the hot air . ''
they really go through and create a framework in which this can become a broad theme , because we need to help for all sides .
there 's some things that have to come together .
that 's a wish .
a very clear wish that we make this technology .
if you just want to take a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a polish , and i love that , or i could choose this wish that 's the essence , <unk> <unk> no longer . i wish i 'm going to take a wish .
this has the biggest impact .
if we do n't get that desire , the dig between the <unk> and the <unk> of people , and the united states and the china and the rich countries , and almost all of this two billion , a lot of worse , it will be very much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
so what do i do for that ?
we need to use more <unk> .
if countries are being able to meet countries like <unk> , you should not talk about carbon emissions .
you should be able to talk to this <unk> graffiti and they 're just wiped out of the ridiculous times that we have spent for these innovative innovative approaches .
we need collusion to control carbon , and more & amp things , that a <unk> is going to make a <unk> .
we have to spread the news .
we have to have been insanely and <unk> and we have to lead , and the things that are going to be undertaken by the government .
it 's a good wish , but i think we can meet it .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand something better -- first of the things , you can be able to give us a idea of magnitude of these investment ?
bill gates gates : to do this simulation on a supercomputer , all big scientists , what we 've done , we just need some 10 million , and even if we have our materials into a russian reactor , to make sure that it works a lot of time , it 's only in the <unk> .
the difficult step is that the building model is built to find more billions , the <unk> and the place that actually construct the first of it .
once the first thing is , if it 's supposed to get this way like , you all know , it 's all clear , because the economy , the most of the <unk> is so different than the <unk> .
and to understand that right ? that means deep in the ground , almost like a dead <unk> , this kind of <unk> <unk> , and then the process starts on the bottom of it ?
bg : exactly . now , you have to have to get the reactor to this , so you have many people and lots of them , and lots of them , you know , you can go wrong and get the operation . this thing you can do . it 's not good !
but if you have a very inexpensive cell , you can do it for 60 years , if you think about a column -- they think of it , without all the <unk> .
and it 's sitting there and it 's done for 60 years .
a nuclear reactor , which is a solution for the garbage .
bg : yes . well , what happens to the garbage is , you can let it go -- there 's less garbage with this method -- then you take it and put it in the next reactor and burn it up .
and we begin by using the waste that exists already in this auditorium or <unk> in the daytime , or <unk> in the daytime , and that 's our high-capacity water .
so , what we have is , what we put in our own , and then the <unk> dramatically reduce dramatically , as this process .
but while you have different people in the world about this particular opportunities .
where is the biggest interest , so what really does ?
bg : so now we have n't waste on a place , and there 's a lot of interesting tv for all the `` nuclear '' for everything that 's `` nuclear '' for all the `` nuclear '' '' `` nuclear '' '' `` nuclear '' '' `` nuclear '' '' `` nuclear '' '' `` nuclear '' '' `` nuclear '' '' `` nuclear '' '' `` nuclear '' '' `` nuclear '' '' `` nuclear '' '' `` nuclear '' '' `` nuclear '' '' `` nuclear '' '' `` nuclear '' '' `` nuclear '' '' `` nuclear '' '' `` nuclear '' '' `` nuclear '' '' `` nuclear '' '' `` nuclear '' '' `` nuclear '' '' `` nuclear '' '' `` nuclear '' '' `` nuclear '' '' `` nuclear , ''
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something that 's made .
this is a nuance of one thing that has been done .
so this is a big step forward , but it 's like a faster reactor and some countries have this built , so everyone has a fast reactor , a <unk> for our first .
in your idea , how much of you are going to call the person in your life ?
bg : well , we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to the <unk> and 20 years .
that 's kind of the straw that 's what the most common thing we have to be .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything is good , and that 's a big wish , it could be easy .
and luckily today , dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of , which , if they work , they work dozens , and that 's the way to work for their leaders , the solution of the pilot , to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
and it would be a best best , if it can do multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
so we need one answer to every case .
so , what 's the major possible breakthroughs , is the largest thing you know ?
bg : a <unk> is the <unk> .
that would have been a <unk> , but it 's really so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there 's other innovative companies .
you know , we do n't know their work as good as these , but there 's the tuned way of the world 's way .
there 's a scary material which seems a bit hard , but maybe that 's what we might say about us .
and so there 's a different thing , but the beauty of this is that a million times a million times a million times as much energy like one , say , a million times a million times a million times a million times a million times a million times , say , a <unk> , and so if you can deal with the problems and the cost , the economic and the cost , the impact of the world and other things , almost in a very literal grade .
if that works , what ?
do we have to introduce <unk> communication to keep trying to keep the <unk> stable ?
bg : if you come to this situation , it 's like you have to be a heart attack , and what do you do ? you might need a <unk> or the same .
there 's a <unk> that 's called the <unk> , which is taking together with multi-material techniques to delay the warming , so we have a lot of time to <unk> that 30 or 30 years .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope we do n't need .
some people say , you should n't be able to do it with insurance because you might have to be able to be able to be <unk> , because you know that one will save the most peaceful .
i do n't know if this problem is , if you 're going to turn out of this problem , but there 's a discourse in the way that you should have to have that to be available , if things are going to happen , or that innovation needs to be faster than we expect .
<unk> : do you have a or two sentences to be able to convince you ?
bg : well , sadly life is life in a very different place .
those of the scientific arguments are very little .
tell you that there are negative impacts that are going to move with the clouds , things are going to move ?
there 's very , very few things that you can ever say , that there 's a chance a million .
so here 's how aids , it 's as aids .
you make a mistake now , and you pay for it very much later .
and so the idea now , when you have all sorts of <unk> problems , you 're just something that you 're just later -- and then , the capital report is n't so clear , and it 's coming in the wealthy world , and you 're going to look at the world 's people who look at the other , and you 're going to see that investment is n't a big deal of sculpture .
the fact is that this uncertainty should be worrying about us .
but my dream here is that if you can harness it economic , and at the same time , the skeptics says , `` okay , it 's not a carbon dioxide , i wish it did , but i 'll accept it , because it 's cheaper than the previous method . ''
and that would be your answer to the <unk> argument that if you 're all that time and energy to solve the carbon problem , all the other goals , the <unk> , the food supply of malaria , and so on , that there 's a dumb waste of resources , to invest money , while there 's better things we can do .
bg : well , the actual number of research that is research for the research -- say , the u.s. emissions should be 10 billion per year to spend today -- that 's not so dramatic .
it should n't suffer things that 's not the other things that 's like that .
you get to big <unk> , and here 's a common-sense people can get reasonable people if you have something that 's not economic and tries to fund it , but it 's going to be most of the waste for me .
it 's because you 're very short of a <unk> and a half , and i 'm only getting the brakes to the time , and i think we should be more things that we have to be a lot more cheaper .
if the acacia sands you get , you get a very high rate , you can just keep the rich ones .
i mean , every one of us might spend five times more for our power without a lifestyle .
and for the top two billion , but it 's a disaster .
and even <unk> .
and his new <unk> is now , `` why is n't the research to be unknown ? ''
he 's still still because of his earlier stories , with the <unk> , but he understood that the one is a very rich group and so he 's now doing the <unk> .
and this is a piece of being on i 'm appropriate for appropriate .
the research is , it 's crazy , like somehow the people are going to be .
bill , i believe i 'm going to all of all the people here , i think that your desire is going to be true . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> called the <unk> .
the idea is pretty simple . it 's got the world 's generating <unk> structure with 20 , about <unk> , about <unk> <unk> and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow is going to be on top .
and even though it does really seem to be really hard , it 's really hard because it 's people moving very quickly .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a <unk> .
it was a huge treat .
so since then , i was doing about 70 health across the world , with students , <unk> and architects , even with the <unk> , and there 's something that 's a deep thing that allows deep parenting to collaborate in the nature of collaboration , and i want to share some of them .
normally most people will get themselves about the task to be .
they talk about what it is , you 're going to think about it , you 're doing it in order to do .
and then they 're spending a little time into planning and organization . it 's mostly coming .
they 're spending a lot of their time into the <unk> and <unk> structures .
and finally , just before they have no time , someone puts the marshmallow , and they put him gently on the top , step back and <unk> your work .
but , almost always , it 's the `` <unk> '' because the weight of the video that 's going to be legitimate and <unk> .
there 's a number of people who have much more mature than others , and under the worst , fresh <unk> .
they lie , they 're <unk> , they 're confused and they really make a lot of really diffuse .
and of course , there 's also teams of the <unk> , and the best are fresh trials in the <unk> .
and that 's pretty amazing .
as peter did n't go back to the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is : how come ? why ? why ? what ?
and peter 's saying , `` neither of the children 's living time is the man 's edge . ''
they do n't invest time in <unk> .
but there 's another reason .
and that 's where they were <unk> , they were getting to find a right plan , ok !
and then , you see it .
so what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you have no time and what happens ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what 's different things is that they start with the marshmallow and prototypes , and they build prototypes , and at the top of the top , so they 're going to repair the way to repair the way they were able to repair the way to repair the way .
<unk> of them are actually using these kinds of cooperation as a core of a <unk> .
and with everyone trying to get the children to give you what works and what do n't .
so the performance of work with prototypes , is a lot of -- but we 'll notice how different teams work .
the average of the average for most of them , most of them , in the other , making a little bit , some more , more , but not much , more resilient than the adults .
who 's the most successful ?
architects and engineers , thankfully .
<unk> is the most the highest , which i 've seen .
and why ? because they 're understanding and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to build stable structures .
`` sending injuries is something about average . but here 's interesting .
you 're looking at a <unk> administrator on the team , they 're getting significant significant .
it 's amazing . you see , and you can see , `` this team will win . ''
you can predict the future . why is that ?
because they have special skills of the brain industry .
they 're running the process , you understand him .
and that team , which is getting the weight and the work , the performance of the team is better .
information skills and <unk> and their own ones .
if you have 10 teams , the typical way they get to the typical are about six , the solid structures .
i tried to go to a little bit .
i thought , let 's make the most remote spot .
so i asked a $ $ $ $ $ $ a $ <unk> for the winner .
what do you think about this <unk> ?
what was the result ?
here 's a thing . not a team , a robust structure .
if someone had a <unk> high entry , it would have been <unk> .
so is n't it interesting that high of the <unk> have a strong effect strong ?
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
so what do you think about ?
now , they 're understood the advantage of the `` spring . ''
so , in the same , bad team of one under the best .
it 's the highest construction in the least of the least .
there 's been <unk> lessons for us to think about the relationship and success .
so , why would someone do spend the world 's <unk> ?
the reason is , i 'm going to make digital tools and processes to help teams , to help , video games and `` the old encouragement . ''
and what 's the <unk> , they helps to identify some assumptions .
because , frankly , it has its own signature .
the challenge is a common experience , a common language , and <unk> , the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience that this simple exercise is .
and those of them who interest in , can be <unk> .
it 's a blog where you can see how to build the marshmallow .
there 's a <unk> there .
they find crazy examples of all the world , like people the system is taking and <unk> .
there 's also <unk> .
and the cynical lesson i believe is that the construction is actually a <unk> sports .
it 's getting that we 're all giving our senses on the task , and that we think we think that we think of our emotions and our do , in the challenge , that 's what lies us .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience everything , what it takes us to do is from a `` <unk> '' moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you very much .
so as we could have a machine here , we have a machine .
a big machine , a cool machine machine , and that 's a time .
and everybody in this room has to be in .
and you can go into the past ; you can not be in here and stay now .
and i wonder what they 're going to vote because i was going to have that question quite a while , and they wanted to go to the past .
i do n't know . they wanted to go back before the cars were , or twitter or `` america 's in the country . ''
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced that you 're somehow drawn to the success , too .
and i understand that .
i am not part of this group , i have to say .
i do n't want to go into the past , and that 's not because i 'm a <unk> .
it 's because of the possibilities of this planet , you go ahead .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the biggest time that 's ever on this planet , no matter what scale them are , health , mobility , opportunities , <unk> .
and there never had a time like this .
my <unk> died , everybody was her .
my grandparents went down to 70 .
my parents are the 80 to the <unk> .
so that 's a nine one of my favorite <unk> .
but it 's not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child , which is capable of a new school , perhaps long to live as long as the richest man in the world , 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox . the smallpox had billion people on this planet killed .
they have new sand pilots in a way of new , which is no war .
they 're gone . they 're gone .
we have <unk> . it 's shaking .
in the rich world , diseases that millions of us just have an even generation of us , barely yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
anybody else knows what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , that are successes of scientific technology .
and from my perspective , the scientific method , things can try to look , to change it , it works , it works if it works , it 's the most of the great achievements of humanity .
so that 's the good news .
unfortunately , this is the most exciting one , because there 's some other problems , and it has been often .
and one of those is that , despite all of our achievements , a billion people in this world go to bed every day .
this number goes up , and they 're getting very fast , and that 's embarrassing .
and not only that , we have our ability to be used to have the same way to have its own world .
drinking , <unk> land , rainforests , oil , gas : they 're disappearing , and that 's happening , and if we do n't get us from this chaos we 're going to get to we 're going to get us from this chaos we 're going to get .
so the question is , can we do that ? i think .
i think it 's clear that we can produce food that will feed billions , without the country that they live .
i think we can handle this world with energy that they 're not in the same time .
i do n't think that 's true , and no , that 's not wishful .
but that 's what i 'm talking about here -- one of the things that i 'm going to do , and we have never needed this much more powerful way now , not yet .
and we were never able to get it in the position , and it was like we can now .
we 're amazing at the cusp of amazing , amazing events on many parts , and yet i think we 've had hundreds of , 300 years before the educational system , to get back to more than the time we have to have these things to be more sensitive than now .
people respond to their believe , and that 's so closely so intimately you ca n't free .
not even the truth you 're free .
and hear it 's a right on his opinion ; even a right to its opinion , for progress .
but you know what you do n't have right ?
they do n't have a right to your own facts . <unk> , they do n't .
and i needed one while to figure out this .
it was about a decade ago , i wrote an article about `` the new yorker , '' a little paper .
and i was amazed to the ground , on the end of the most effective health , in public health care in public health .
i did n't know what i was supposed to do , so i was just doing what i 'm writing , i wrote a paper and went forward .
and then , i wrote a paper about <unk> technology .
the same thing , only bigger .
people were playing nuts .
so i wrote a paper , and i could n't understand why people thought that molecule would be a random sort of self-serving , why they were , that molecule was a random sort of a random <unk> of nature .
but you know , i do what i 'm doing . i wrote the articles , i kept on .
i mean , i 'm a journalist .
we 're going to do , we 're going to eat , we 're going to eat that , that 's okay .
but that articles made me worried , and i could n't figure out why , and eventually , i found out .
and that 's because these unexamined that <unk> that i did n't have a <unk> .
these were <unk> people , people , <unk> people .
they were just like people in this room .
and this led me to be so profound ...
but then i thought , well , let me be honest .
we 're on a point where we do n't have the same relationship to the progress in the way .
we 're talking about <unk> .
we 're talking about , with little trepidation , with little trepidation about this .
okay , for that reason , there is some reasons , and i think what will be .
we have faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in the science where science was n't supposed to be so much .
you can just give a few names and people understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
and there are questions and problems with people that we thought they would have to be right . so they were feeling like that .
ask , ask , ask you , you ask the evidence , you ask .
take a look at nothing .
but now , it 's what 's coming , if you have to get evidence that particular , and that 's not that we 're not .
and i can tell you that we now live in an epidemic of the fear of the fear of how i 've never seen , and hopefully it 's going to be seen again .
about 12 years ago , a story , a horrible story that <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
very scary .
and the studies was to see if the crash was true .
there should be done by trial ; that 's a serious thing .
data came in .
the data came in from the u.s. , from england , from sweden , from the u.s. , from the u.s. , from the u.s. , from the u.s. , from the u.s. , from the u.s. , from the u.s. , from the u.s. , from the u.s. , from the u.s. , from the u.s. , from the u.s. , from the u.s. , and they were all alike , no correlation , no
it does n't make any difference . it does n't matter any difference because we believe in general , we think , what we see is what we think is that we feel real .
we do n't think of a bunch of documents from a <unk> that 's us , and i understand that , i think , i think , i think , that 's what we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of it was devastating .
so , in fact , the united states is one of the only countries in the world , in which the <unk> of the trade rate is to come down .
that 's a <unk> and we should be ashamed .
it 's bad .
what happens is that we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because someone is going to make someone ?
has a single one in the audience ever ever see in the <unk> of someone else ?
it 's not quite often .
it 's not in this country , but it 's actually going to look at the world last year .
they 're many deaths by producing deaths , 20 per hour .
but because that 's what happened here , we can launch it , and people like an <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of platforms like guitar and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> live live .
and you can do that because they 're cause to be able to connect .
they do n't understand that these things seem to be a matter but never the same thing .
and that 's something we need to learn , and that 's very quick .
this guy was a hero , jonas ,
he <unk> us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
no fear , no one , <unk> , <unk> .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he 's called paul <unk> .
he just developed with a couple of other people a <unk> .
it can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 kids a year in the developing world .
pretty good , right ?
well , that 's good , apart from that , paul <unk> and talking about vaccines , and then you 're just going to stop laughing .
and that tells you that .
so , paul is a <unk> .
if paul was really talking about a public <unk> , he ca n't be talking about not just a fad .
he gets calls home , because people like to tell you that you know where to go to school .
and why ? what did he did a kick input .
i do n't need that , but that 's the way to do is a lot of a second .
you take them to go back to the sickness of , terrible diseases , and that 's happening .
we 're getting away in this country now .
and that 's getting worse , and it 's going to be soon as you die to it , because that 's just one issue .
and they 're not just dying to hackers .
what is the wet with household ? do we use that . why ?
a <unk> of mine wrote a few weeks ago , and i think i 'd like to make a little too busy .
nobody ever said before .
she would not vaccinate her kid . absolutely not .
it 's both .
why ? because we do n't have a <unk> . and you know what ?
we had yesterday , in this country yesterday .
today , i do n't know , maybe i was in lagos , somebody in lagos , and he 's now at los angeles , at the moment , he 's about ohio .
and in a few hours , he lands a car , and it comes back to long beach , and he 's one of these <unk> <unk> at night tonight .
and he does n't know that he 's a <unk> disease , and we do n't know that , because this is the world .
that 's the planet we live on . do n't it be as if it 's not .
we love to paint ourselves in lying . we love that .
do you have all your high account of this morning ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , which helps you respond to the rule .
i know they did that because half of americans do it every day .
they take the stuff , and you take an alternative to do , and it does n't matter how often we find out of it .
the data was happening all the data .
they 're <unk> their organs . more they never do .
that 's okay , you want to be going to want to be 28 billion dollars for the dark language .
i agree with you .
it 's dark . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do it ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the leader .
we hate a big government . we do n't trust in the system .
and we should n't do it . our health system is closed .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and <unk> self that can afford it .
so we 're going to walk away , and where do we go ?
we 're running in the poor of the <unk> .
that 's great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this is really a serious thing , because the stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars .
and i all kind of little fans here .
none of it -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , there 's no time , what that is , but we give billions of dollars for it , it 's cheating .
and you know what ? if i say that , i tell people the people and say , `` what ? do you think ? let 's make people what they want .
and you feel good . ''
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
because it does n't matter whether it 's the minister that says , `` hmm , i 'm not going to have to embrace the wisdom of my experts , or some <unk> who wants to treat his patients with <unk> .
if you 're moving on this way , where believe and magic are replacing science , they 're going to be a place that you want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he took 400,000 times the people to think that the red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , much longer than any drugs we know , that they can be the protected of aids .
hundreds of thousands of death deaths in a country , which is worse than any other one of these disease .
tell me , please , these things are not such such a consequences .
they have . they 're always .
well , the most common epidemic that we 're right now is , this is fight in which we 're right in this ridiculous , battle between the <unk> <unk> , food <unk> , and the <unk> .
that 's a <unk> debate . it has to stop .
it 's a debate about words about words , about metaphors .
that 's a ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every <unk> , every branch , every branch , every <unk> , has been changed by the people .
you know , there was no clan schools per month .
there was no sheep-like criteria .
there was no bills . we did all of this .
we did it in the last four years .
and some of it has worked and some of them .
we are anxious , which has n't work .
now , we can make it more , and of course , there 's risks . but we can do something like vitamin a <unk> , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people to prolong their lives .
you do n't want to do that ?
i have to say that i do n't understand .
we genetically measured <unk> , <unk> .
why do we do it ?
now , what i 'm hearing is , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we do n't want big , and that 's wrong .
we do n't want companies to get a life of life .
we do n't want companies to have the seeds .
and you know what my answer is ?
yes , they 're right . let it tell us .
it 's true , we have a huge <unk> , but that 's not science .
that 's not with science .
it 's quite quite morality , <unk> .
you know that the science is not a company .
it 's not a country .
it 's not one idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it works , but the idea that we should do the science to do , to do it , because we have a real burning , and they 're holding millions of people by people by the enlightenment .
you know , in the next 50 years , we 'll be more food growing , and it 's 70 percent .
these investment in africa in africa in africa in africa .
embarrassing . <unk> .
they need that , and we do n't .
and why ? <unk> , <unk> food .
we do n't want to encourage people to get this <unk> thing to eat the same thing , like <unk> .
<unk> is something that 's half a billion people .
it 's about a sort of potato .
it 's just a sack . it 's closed .
it has no nutrients , it has no protein , and scientists are building all this just in it .
and then people could eat the food and they would n't be blind .
you would not verify , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it would n't be <unk> , but it would be nice .
and all i can say to this is : why do we fight this ?
i mean , why are we fighting this ?
because we want to want to have the genes .
it 's not about genes . it 's not about chemicals .
it 's not about our very passion for hormones , our value on greater food , better food , a more food food .
it 's not about cutting <unk> , it 's about people living alive , and it 's going to understand what that means .
because , you know what ?
if we do n't do that , if we do so further , we do n't think about something guilty that we do n't want to be guilty , <unk> colonialism .
there 's no other description for what 's going on .
it 's selfish , it 's ugly , it 's not worthy of it , and we have to stop it .
so after this incredibly , weird , weird , excellent entertainment might want you , `` you want to put you to all this ridiculous , and you go to the future ? ''
absolutely . that 's what i want to do .
and at the moment , it 's in the present , but we have an incredible possibility .
we can ask this kind of time to what we want .
we can <unk> them , where we want to do it , and we 're going to move them to where we want .
we have to make these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to the time and we 're going to be happy to have that .
i know we can , and as far as i 'm concerned , is something that 's needs the world .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i 'm looking at the <unk> , and it 's a strange sense of being interested in this , and it 's like , as `` a deception that 's going to be something that 's true when someone just found enough to you . ''
in other words , <unk> have a major powerful impact , the <unk> , and only because the person thinks that you might think about it is a nuclear or a kind of ... in <unk> , for example , it 's like if the patient is just found enough , a map of the brain in the body that you call the <unk> .
one of the delusion is something that 's something that you do .
so , let 's also understand each other , i want to show you a fundamental , very simple guilt .
and i 'm going to show you how it works . this is a trick , who has to be at least the 1950s in every country for children .
i 've got him from the <unk> , the <unk> in the 1970s .
i 'm going to do it for you and then .
and then i 'm going to explain why i explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife you can study , my hand , that you can study .
i will just hold the knife in my own .
i 'm going to go back to my sleeve .
and to make sure nothing in my sleeve hand , or from him , i just get my wrist on this .
and you can see that it 's time to get anything else , and as long as i 'm here , nothing in my sleeve , or come out .
and the goal is very simple .
i 'm going to open my hand , and hopefully , if all walks well , the knife came through my bare physical <unk> .
it 's actually going to be so robust to his place that i can shake it without the knife .
nothing goes in my sleeve or step out , not a <unk> . and you can look at all .
<unk> !
now , this is a trick i often learn to be a little kids that look at love for love , because you can learn to be very much about deception , when you look at it , even though it 's a very simple thing to be appropriate .
probably , many of you here in the room that 's this trick .
so he does this .
i think knife in my hand .
i say , i 'm getting my wrist away to make sure that nothing in my sleeve hand or step , and that 's a lie .
the reason i could hold my wrist , is that there 's the sort of mystery of illusion .
in the moment , where i 'm going to put my hand away from you to see them from the back of the back , this guy walks here , my <unk> , just from the place that he was in a position that he 's so cheap .
great trick ?
there 's somebody who had no childhood .
so , it 's here . it 's exactly .
and when i <unk> , you change the mind .
and now you might talk why this is a delusion , why you do n't know that there 's only three fingers , because the mind and the way he 's sort of information , it does n't count , one , two , three , but it 's a group .
but that 's not what 's happening here . and then i get my hand .
of course , there 's been there in there , but not by the <unk> of my body , but through a trick , through my <unk> , who is now .
and when i close my hand , the same thing is , when i 'm going to close to my hand , the same thing is , when i 'm going to get away from this motion , that they will <unk> again .
i 'll take that hand away . and here it is .
this trick can be your friends and neighbor . thank you .
now , what did this mean to do with the purchasing ?
a year or a year or so , i was a study that really has been understood .
i 'm not a doctor or researchers , and that 's why it was an amazing thing .
it 's what 's true : if you 're lied to a white pill , in the form of a <unk> , is that it just is a round of the effect , white pill , that effect a certain amount of reasoning effect .
but if you 're going to take the shape in the way that you 're going to divide the same thing , for example , to shift in a smaller pill , and that blue and you have a letter on it , it 's actually measurable efficient .
and that , even though , any of those -- it 's just <unk> .
but a white car is not as good as a blue ball .
what ? that made me really upset me .
but it turns out that it 's not all of that .
if you 're using the cell phones , again , are still more effective than any of the other .
a colored drop on a close yellow and on the other red , is better than a white cell .
also , the most pessimistic games in the play matter .
a pill twice a daily daily is not as good as three pills -- i ca n't remember the exact opposite pills , i 'm sorry .
but the subject is ,
... that also play a role .
and the shape play is a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate circuit , you have to reach your needle .
right ? a tube gun with a <unk> -- a <unk> with a <unk> substance that you 'd really mean .
this is creating a very strong image in your head , and that 's very much more than a white ball .
this chart is really -- i 'm going to show you a different time , if we have a <unk> .
so , the fact is that the white pill pill is n't as good as the blue pill , that does n't seem as well as a <unk> that does n't really feel as good as the needle .
and none of it has really <unk> property , it 's just our belief that we made a stronger impact .
i wanted to know if i could be able to use this idea for a magic model .
i 'll take something that 's obviously a deception , and let 's be a real look .
we know from the study that you have to reach your needle , if it 's supposed to go to the thing .
this is a 18 inches long , and it 's very , very <unk> . and i 'm going to make you a little bit of math .
this is really my 50th meat . it 's not <unk> of humor meat .
this is my skin . this is not a <unk> tool .
i 'm going to stick this needle into my skin and through them , and again , to get again again .
if you 're going to fall out , if you fall easy in your bags -- i 've spent the <unk> last night last night in the hotel room , and some people i did n't know , and then a woman has become close to close .
so i 'm suggesting if you 're going to get bored as fast , you 'll look at the next 30 seconds , or you know , what i 'm going to do is the first <unk> of the back here .
you can see it in the same , you can also be able to get <unk> , if you want .
so , it 's like this , right here , where my meat starts , the bottom part of my network , i just wo n't make a little <unk> .
i 'm sorry . do you make it crazy ?
and now you just want to just take a little bit through my skin and on the other side .
now we 're actually in the same situation we have in the same situation we had .
it 's about .
but now you can not count my finger , right ?
so i 'm going to show you , this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when you see that .
they say , `` okay , that 's not as silly and <unk> yourself , just to have a few minutes to have . ''
well , i 'll show you .
so what do you look like ? pretty good .
yes , i know .
and people in the back up to the other hand , `` okay . i 've never seen it right . ''
the people in the front ages are now in the winter community ,
let me show you with you .
this is really my skin . this is n't a chinese restaurant .
that 's my meat , and i can <unk> the chamomile problem .
sorry . if you 're relieved , look away , look at it .
the people in the back up , or the ones that later later on the video again , say , `` well , this is what it would look like , but if it 's real , he would -- you see , you know , there 's a hole and there , if it was really real , it would be upset . ''
okay , let me make some blood , for you .
yes , there 's it .
now , normally i would use the needle .
i would clean my arm and make them that there are no <unk> .
but i think , in this context , and with the intention of being , i 'm going to make a real thing , i just want to let the needle just as well , and you can go to the stage .
we 'll take a couple of times a few times .
i hope you 're looking for me . thank you very much .
everybody 's talking today about happiness .
i 've been doing some people the number of books that are published with `` <unk> '' in the last five years and they would give them about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there 's an enormous wave of the interest of the interest of researchers at the memory .
there 's a lot of <unk> .
everybody would love to make people happier .
but despite all of these <unk> , there are several cognitive material that are really impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is basically mainly from these cognitive traps .
that 's true for h.r that , in fact , to think about your own happiness , and it 's true for scientists who think we 're just so superior to everybody else .
the first one of those traps is a <unk> , complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is not a one-time word , because we apply it to many different things .
i think there 's a certain reason that we might be able to harness , but in the big and all , the complicated way we have to think about , and we 'll think the complicated way to think about what 's significant .
the second thing is a substantial freak of experience and memory : basically , it 's between being in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they 're both tan in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that 's the number of fact that we do n't think about a situation that does physical decision-making without its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive event .
there 's just no way to get it right .
now , i would like to begin with a toy , who had a <unk> , after my lectures , who was a story , and it was totally beautiful music , and at the end of the actual mind , there was a <unk> sound .
and then he put it , really emotional , that has felt the whole experience .
but it did n't .
what had never had done it was the memory of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of <unk> music .
she did n't <unk> , because he was a memory , and the memory was ruined , and memory was all he had to keep .
what we really do is that we might think about ourselves and other people might be in two different ways of self .
there 's a <unk> self , which is alive in the present and the present , capable of being transported back to experience , but essentially , in basically , the present .
it 's the <unk> itself , the doctor 's physician -- you know when the doctor asks , `` does it hurt , if i 'm wearing it ? ''
and then there 's a <unk> self , and the <unk> itself is that the <unk> and the story of our lives and it 's the question , `` how did you have felt at last lately ? ''
or , `` how did you get to albania ? '' or so much like the journey .
these are two very different entities , the hunter-gatherer self itself and the <unk> self , and the two people are part of the <unk> of the happiness .
well , the <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and this is what it starts with a fundamental reaction to your memory -- it starts to start it .
we do n't just tell stories if we 're doing it , we 're going to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we 're allowed to do is we 're all going to be in our audience a story .
and let 's start with one example here .
there 's a old study .
these are real patients that have been <unk> in a painful procedure .
i 'm not going to go into the details . it 's not painful , but it was painful when this trial was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report , all the 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they 're asked , `` who else have more ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
patient b is clearly . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain that 's a patient b , and more than that , and it 's more than the patient 's patient , and more than that .
but there 's another question , `` how much did these patients have been doing that ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient is a much more frustrating <unk> of the cancer treatment for the patient .
the stories of the sinusoids have different , and because a very important part of history is what it ends up .
and none of the stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is worse than the other .
and the worse thing that was worse , where the pain was at the end on its peak , it 's a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we 've asked these people to their <unk> , and we too much later , `` how did all of bad was the whole thing ? ''
and she was much worse for a than for b in the <unk> .
now , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> itself and the <unk> .
from the <unk> self , b is a total time in the <unk> .
now , what you might do a point is a point of a patient , and we have clinical trials in the book , and it 's done , and it 's working , you might actually be able to get the <unk> of the tube inside the tube without him without firing the tube inside it .
that will happen to be a little bit less than it 's , and much less than it .
and if you do that a few minutes , you can say that the <unk> self itself is a worse , and you have to say that the self itself is a much better , because now you have a better story to the experience .
what did a story is from ?
and that 's true for the stories that tell the memory , and it 's also true for the stories that we make .
what you have is , you know , what you 're looking at is more likely to be more powerful moments and end .
and end , it 's very , very important , and in this case , <unk> this .
now , the <unk> self itself lives its lives in itself .
it 's moments of the <unk> , one of the other .
and they ask , what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're lost forever .
i mean , most of our moments , our lives -- and i have this -- you know , the psychological present for one seconds , which means that it 's about 600 million of them , and in a month there is about 600,000 . most of you do n't want to do not leave .
most of you are completely ignored by the <unk> self .
and yet , you kind of have the sense that they should count , what is happening in the genesis of the brain revolution .
it 's the limited resource we use , as we are in the world .
and as we do it , it 's important to be important , but that 's not the story that 's keeping the self 's self for us .
so we have the reckless self and the <unk> self , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is the deal of time .
so , from the perspective of self , if you have a holiday , and the second one week is exactly the first , the <unk> child <unk> twice as good as the <unk> vacation .
that 's not what the <unk> of it does n't work .
for the sake of self , a <unk> holiday barely barely than the average page , because there 's no media memory .
they do n't have changed the story .
and on this case , time , critical variable that it 's different from a <unk> self , and , in time , very little bit of a little bit of a little bit of that story .
now , the <unk> itself is doing more than remembering and stories .
it 's actually the same thing that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who 's saying , we have to have surgeons , two <unk> , two different surgeons , and you know what he wants to vote , and that 's the surgeon who will get to recognize .
the problem of self itself has no voice in this choice .
in fact , we do n't choose between us . we choose between memory on experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we do n't think about our future as a experiences .
we think about our future as a <unk> memory .
and basically , you can think about this , you know , as a <unk> <unk> , and you can think that your body self is thinking as one , which is the <unk> self and the <unk> in the <unk> of experiences that does n't need the <unk> self .
i have the sense that if we 're going to have to holiday , this is what we 're going to do is , we 're actively breeding <unk> in the services of the <unk> self .
and that 's a little bit hard to have , i think .
i mean , how much does we memories ?
that 's one of the things that will be given for the dominance of the planet itself .
and when i think about it , i think about a holiday that we 've done some years ago , and i think that 's a lot of it in the relationship , how often i think about others .
and i probably believe of my memory to this <unk> journey , i would say about 25 minutes to go out the last four years .
well , if i had the tv thing , with the 600 pictures i 'd spent in a more hour .
well , these are three weeks , and that 's the number one , and that 's the same time .
there seems to be a consequence .
well , i like a little extreme , you know , in this , how much deep i have the most advanced appetite on memory , but even when you 're doing more , there 's a real question . why are we going to reactivate a lot of weight on the dopamine who we 're flourishing ?
so i want you to think about a thought .
so let 's imagine your next holiday , you know , you know , at the end of the day , you have to have all your images , and they get a <unk> drug , so you will be anything like that .
well , would you choose the same holidays ?
and if you pick a other officer , there 's a conflict between your two senses of self , and you have to think about how to the conflict , and it 's not obvious , because if you think of time in time , they get one answer , and if you think of memories , they 'll get a different answer .
why we have the reckless test we choose a problem that makes us with a choice between the two types of self .
now , the two people who are calling two terms of happiness .
there 's actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one of a self .
so you can ask , how do you think of the <unk> self ?
and then they would ask , how happy are the moments of the <unk> themselves in the year themselves ?
and they 're all -- happiness is a pretty complicated process .
so what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and by the way , we 're capable of getting a pretty good idea of happiness from the happiness of the present self over time .
if you 're looking at happiness 's happiness , it 's a very different thing .
that 's not about how happy people live .
it 's about being satisfied or delighted , if this person thinks about your life .
very different realized .
anybody who 's not going to screw these terms of happiness is going to screw the exploration of happiness , and i 'm also a lot of researchers about well-being that have been <unk> exploration in the same way .
the distinction between happiness is the luck of the <unk> self and happiness 's <unk> itself is discovered in the last few years , and now you 're trying to measure the two together .
the motor organization has developed a global survey , and the more than a half million people ask them , and they have the experiences . and there was other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started to learn about happiness of the happiness of self .
and the environmental lesson we think i think is that they 're really different .
you can know how much he 's with his life , and you do n't really know how much he lives his life and the vice versa .
just to give you an idea of the heat , the power is about .
what that means is that if you come to somebody , and you 'd say , oh , his dad is a <unk> , how much would you know ?
well , you would know something about your size , but there 's a lot of uncertainty .
you have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody 's going to be your life when eight of 10 resnick is eight on a scale of 10 resnick of 10 resnick of 10 resnick of 10 resnick of 10 resnick cells , they have a lot of uncertainty about how to do it with his <unk> .
so the production path is to be small .
we know something about what the happiness of the <unk> means .
we know money is very important , we 're goals with a lot of things .
we know happiness is that we 're happy with people who like to spend time with people that we like .
there 's other delight , but that 's what it is .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two senses of self , they 're going to do very different things .
and the implication of the conclusion from what i said here is that we should not have to think about a conservation tool for well-being .
it 's a completely different word .
now , at a nutshell , another reason we 're not clear in the same thing that we think about life and when we live in life .
so if you ask the simple question as you 're happy to california , you 're not going to get the right answer .
if you think , they 're thinking that people have to be happier in california , if you 're saying , in ohio life .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference , we 're saying , in the climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the ministry of self , and it 's not even very important for the <unk> self , which decides how happy people are .
now , because the point itself is responsible , you can end up on the end -- some people , and they 're going to california .
and it 's sort of interesting to track , what happens to people , which is to be in california in hopes to be happier .
now , your <unk> self is not getting happier .
we know that .
but one thing is happening . they think they 're happier , because if you think about it , you 're going to think about how awful the weather was in ohio , and they feel like they 've met the right decision .
it 's very difficult to think about comfort thinking , and i hope i have a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you very much .
now , when we looked at a few weeks ago , they were given to me that there was a pretty interesting outcome , which came from this crime trip .
is this something that you can make us as you can be empowered , because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure . sure .
i think the most exciting thing we 've found in the cybersecurity department of the success department of the success department , which is a number that we have to have expected to have .
we found that in terms of the happiness of the world themselves .
when we looked at how emotions to the income .
and it turns out that , under a $ $ 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and that 's a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it 's a big demographic sample , under a $ income of the $ six dollars in the year .
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year are unhappy , and they 're increasingly less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less than ever going to be .
and we 'll get a perfectly flat line on it .
i mean , i 've barely seen this bird lines .
what happens is , obviously , that money does n't have a monopoly , but that 's not a lack of money , and we can measure this misery very , very clearly .
in the spirit of the other self , the <unk> self , you get another story .
the more money you have is the only thing you 're ever .
that 's not for emotion .
but danny , in the whole american sense , it 's about living , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people have to take that magic seriously , i mean , it seems to ask everything to the head , everything that we think of , for example , in terms of a <unk> and so forth .
is there a chance that politicians would be a choice of the country that would take a sense of what the leader would be , and that 's where you would be doing that ?
dk : you know , i believe that there are some incentive for the role of the <unk> in politics .
the truth will be slowly in the united states , not a question , but in the united kingdom , they 're just in other countries .
people are in the case that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
it 's going to be a while , and people are going to have to study whether they want to study clusters or whether they want to explore , so we have to lead this discussion quite soon .
as a result , it can be very different depending on how to think and how they 're thinking about the problem of yourself , or if they 're thinking about the most vulnerable themselves .
that 's going to be politics , i think , in the next year .
in the united states , you 're in the united states , you 're getting to measure the <unk> of the population .
that 's going to be part of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me , this theme , or should least be the most political debate over the next couple of years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i 'm an old duck . i 'm doing video game .
i 've been running away now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to save the world in reality , how she 's in <unk> .
i have a plan for that . i want to convince more people , including them all of them , more time to spend more time to play with play games .
currently now spend three billion hours a week .
some of you might think , `` this is a whole lot of time for games . ''
maybe a little too much time , if you think about how many problems we have to have the real world in the world .
but actually , my research is the art responsible for the future , is the opposite thing .
three billion hours a week is not close to the world of the world of the world .
in fact , i 'm convinced that if we want to survive the next century , we have to increase this time .
i 'm assuming that the previous time is spent over 21 to a week in 21 billion hours .
this might seem to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a button , so i 'm going to repeat it , so it can be : if we 're like hunger , poverty , global warming , global strife , obesity , i think , we have to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week .
no , i mean , really serious .
why ? this image is exactly why i believe that games are so central to survive the human species in the future .
this is a tudor portrait of photographer <unk> .
he wanted to make the feelings of play . so he did a camera out of the players a camera .
so this is one of the classic expressions .
if you do n't have a player , you might recognize some of the modifications in this picture .
you 're probably seeing this sense of urgency , some fear , but also a very complicated problem in solving a real problem .
if you 're playing , you 'll see some of them here , and you 're a sign of optimism . the eyebrow just surprise .
this is a player which is on the edge of a call called <unk> .
oh , you know . ok. well . so we got some players here .
a <unk> victory is a result that 's very positive , that they did n't know it was possible .
it was a very different way to the imagination .
and when they 're reaching it , they 're shocked to be able to get some of these things , which is a premature victory .
this player is a short <unk> victory .
and this is what we have to see in millions of <unk> all the world , if we take the boomers of the next century in utero , the face of those who rely on the brink of a <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we see more like this face in real life , when we face a tough deal of problems .
i 'm going to compare it to life , and it 's my face , you know ? yes ?
so i 'm in my life , i 'm bad .
this is a graffiti in my home home home in berkeley , california , where i was better in play better in games than in real life .
that 's a problem that many players have .
we think that we are not so good as in play .
and i 'm not just doing less , though that 's what we 've heard .
we 're getting into more <unk> . i mean , in the context of the motivation , to do something , to connect together to collaborate with each other .
if we 're in a <unk> , i believe , a lot of us in our best , anytime and immediately are <unk> , <unk> the problem so long , to try to try it to the <unk> again .
and in reality , if we do n't stop , if we poke on obstacles , we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel ourselves , we feel threatened , maybe a lot of , frustrated or <unk> .
we never have these feelings if we play games , it just wo n't .
and that 's what i wanted to study as a minister of the war .
why is it impossible to think , you could n't just get anything ?
how do we make these emotions from play into reality ?
so i looked at play like world of warcraft on the world 's ideal environment , which is the ideal environment to the collaborative problem .
and i 've been seeing some things that are the epic environment in which you can do so possible .
so first , if you put in one of those phrases , especially at the world of warcraft , there are a lot of different characters that are willing to give you a <unk> mission , and that 's instantly .
but not just any mission , but a mission that 's perfect to your current state , right ?
so , let me do that .
they never get a task that you ca n't resolve .
but the edge of your capability , so you have to catch hard , but there 's no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you 're not looking around and you 're <unk> . there 's always really really really really really really really really useful to do anything important .
and there 's certain employees .
everywhere , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to be mission for the fields .
we do n't have the real life that 's in real life , so that feeling that it 's safe to be a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
and then there 's this epic story , this inspiring history , why we are there and what we have .
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
they have driven by `` level of the sun , '' and `` smart strength '' is `` <unk> intelligence . ''
that electronic feedback is not in real life .
if i leave this stage , i do n't leave us , cash talk and intricate , <unk> crazy idea .
i do n't get into real life of feedback .
so the problem of the <unk> , the world of warcraft is that it 's so instinctive anytime at the edge of a <unk> <unk> , that we 'd rather have our whole time into those balloons .
they 're just better than the reality .
so today , all the world of <unk> combined to have been <unk> , <unk> million years after this , the virtual problems of <unk> .
that 's not necessarily bad .
it sounds bad .
but to look at the context , in the context , a million years ago , our first <unk> process began to go .
so the first of the present , so , the first one .
ok , so if we 're talking about how much time we spend with games , makes it sense , when you 're going to have time to the magnitude of human development , what 's very extraordinary .
but also , because it turns out that we use this whole time to play with the same time , actually , the difference that we 're capable of .
we are developing to our local , thank you , thank you .
that 's the truth . that 's what i believe .
now , look at this interesting statistic recently recently found by a scientist of the carnegie mellon university , the average young man , today , in a country , approximately 10,000 hours to <unk> for <unk> hours , <unk> to 21 .
so for 10,000 hours , a pretty interesting number , for two reasons .
first , for children in the united states , <unk> hours are <unk> hours , <unk> you to spend in school , from 5 . in the united states , the high school -- if you do n't .
so , we have a complete <unk> , which is where young people are learning what it means to be a good player , like everything else , what they 're learning from school .
and perhaps some of you have signed the new book of post-traumatic robots , `` <unk> , '' read .
so you know that the theory of the success that gave the theory of the 10,000 hours .
it 's based on the great research that <unk> , if we spend 10,000 hours with the 21st senses , we 're spending spending a single source to the 21st century , a lot of time , we 're spending moving at the end of it .
we 're going to be so good in whatever , whatever the most famous people in the world .
so what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , `` what are the great ? ''
because if we could never find that out there , we never had a lot of time to be there .
so many people have the world in the world that one hour a day with a day .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people are extraordinarily good in `` something . ''
and over the next decade , we have another billion players that are extraordinary in whatever .
if you do n't hear it .
the <unk> developed <unk> , the energy save and on <unk> , rather than the <unk> , so the way on the world , especially in india , china , brazil online .
you expect a extra billion players on the next decade .
so we have a total 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what it is , what is what makes us to do this .
here 's the 4 things i found . so first , <unk> .
okay , so , think of the extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do something , to be a barrier , and that belief that we have a <unk> hope on success .
players think that 's a <unk> victory , and that it 's always worth it 's to try and get it , and that 's the same .
stop , do n't sit around .
players are masters of the <unk> of the <unk> of social networks .
there 's a lot of interesting research that we have to do , and we have more interesting research that we might have to do , after we have always conquered them .
the reason is that there 's a lot of trust with someone to play with somebody a game .
we trust that somebody 's time with us , that the rules are going to be <unk> , we have the same thing and to stay in the course of the way .
so that allows you to grow from the world 's growing way , trust and together .
and as a result , we 're going to build a lot of social relationships .
<unk> . fantastic !
you know , there 's one reason why the $ <unk> of <unk> 's spending 22 hours a week , and you can see it .
the reason is that if we 're playing playing , we 're actually happier in , as if we 're going to do or nothing .
we know that we work as human beings when we 're making hard , big jobs .
and gamers are always prepared to work hard when they get to the right task .
and ultimately , i think , to make it .
players love to be part of being <unk> <unk> .
here 's a <unk> , which is to illuminate the right light , you know , determines all wikipedia , the world 's greatest young disease .
the second thing in the world , with nearly higher probable , is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about the world of warcraft on the internet , and over any other matter of other than any other , in every other young members of the world .
they create a coherent story .
they 're creating a unified source of knowledge of knowledge the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers are like to get one single outcome . that are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
they 're people who believe that they can change as individuals .
and the only problem is that they believe they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
that 's the problem i 'm trying to do with this .
edward livingstone is a <unk> .
his work is genius , and he studies why people spend so much time to spend energy and money in a private sector .
and he says , `` we 're going to get <unk> in a more than virtual worlds and <unk> . ''
and this is a <unk> . so he 's logical .
and he says ...
not like i -- i mean , i think , i think , i 'm a little sharper .
so , it 's saying that makes sense , because players can reach in more than a real life .
they can play stronger social bonds than in the real life , and they get more and <unk> in play as in the real life .
so , he says , it 's currently totally logical logical estimate that players are more time in the virtual world as in the real world .
i just agree , that 's logical .
but it 's definitely not <unk> .
we need to begin to transform the real world in a game .
my inspiration comes from a incident , which is 100 years of research .
there 's this <unk> , which is out of <unk> . you know ?
there was a fantastic <unk> that was <unk> .
and these are kind of thing that was designed to <unk> people .
and when you 're familiar with the <unk> of the old greek <unk> , you may know that story , and the story about how games and why play games .
according to <unk> , games , more <unk> , more <unk> , in the kingdom of famine .
well , what he had was that was that there was such a great famine famine that was the king of <unk> to a fantasy , decided to be a crazy idea .
people were being touched . people were fighting .
it was a extreme situation . you needed a extreme solution .
so they invented , they invented , the <unk> and the <unk> , and the <unk> of a national strategy . the next day , you would play .
and they would be so much caught in the <unk> and they would be playing as amazing as the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> productivity that they would be there to be food .
and then the next day , you would play , and the next day , you would eat .
and it survived them for 18 years , by clicking on a day and the next one .
in the same way , i think we 're playing games .
we are playing games to escape the suffering of the real world .
we 're playing games in order to avoid everything that does n't work in the real world , so that is not so satisfying , and we 're going to get what we need from play .
but it does n't have to be the end .
that 's the exciting thing .
so , after 18 years , i was n't getting better , so the king decided to make a last <unk> .
they shared the kingdom in two .
they were a <unk> , and the winner was sent to a <unk> accident .
she left <unk> , and she got out of looking for a new home . they just left so many people back to the survival and the rest of a site in which they could thrive .
that sounds ridiculous , right ?
but recent <unk> shows that the <unk> that came out of the most violent reich that are later the same dna as the old <unk> .
so scientists came to perception that <unk> was really true .
and geologists found evidence of a global cooling , which was nearly 20 years to explain the famine .
so this crazy story might be true .
you may have saved your people by games by having 18 years and then they have had 18 years and then they have had these <unk> and so much about how much about the other thing that they 've saved was saved the whole civilization .
so , we can also .
we 're playing on a hundred of times of 1994 .
this was the first <unk> of <unk> in the world of <unk> . that was 16 years ago .
she was <unk> 18 years <unk> , we 've been served on 16 years of warcraft .
i 'm assuming we 're willing to play for our own personal game .
so , you 've got half of its civilization , looking for a new world , so i 'm going to take my 21 billion computer per week .
we should be estimated that half of us have a given a day a day with play until we have the problems of the real world .
i know you 're asking , `` how do we solve problems of the real world in games ? '' and that 's exactly what i 'm going to come with my work in the center of the institute for the future .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , it 's how we should be able to understand the future .
we do n't want to try to say the future .
what we want to do is the future .
we want to think the best outcome , and then people make it to make this idea into reality .
we 're going to think of an epic spectrum , and we give people the possibilities of them .
i 'm going to show you three games that i designed to try to try to do people in their own future .
this is `` world without oil . ''
the game is from 2007 .
it 's a <unk> that they have to study a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we have plenty enough , so it 's realistic for you , and they get enough to get oil , and then you get enough to get oil , and then you get enough to blog about stealing , to take videos or listen to .
we tested this game with <unk> players in 2007 , and we 've been talking about the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was an experience experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it 's good for the environment or because we should .
but when they 're in a <unk> , and they say , `` we 're going to get this oil . ''
that 's a fascinating , which you 're all about .
find out how they would survive , most of our players have gone in the game of habits .
so we have a bigger game for the next olympics , a bigger , more objective , more and more objective than just <unk> .
we 've developed the game `` design '' at the future , we have developed the future .
it 's calculation that one thing that people are only 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer , `` global <unk> , '' of course , `` global <unk> . ''
the call from players , the way , we 're almost like a `` <unk> . ''
you know , they know jerry <unk> , where there 's `` boomerang '' '' they have the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> , and only in the world , they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , say everybody is in the <unk> , and it 's our job , the future for energy , food , security , security and the future of social justice .
so 8,000 players played playing the game eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions they can read when they 're <unk> .
and the last game we 'll get on the three game is this game in conjunction with the world bank .
if you 're following the game , you get from the world bank , `` social <unk> , '' in 2010 .
we 're working with universities in all sub-saharan africa and perceives them , to learn social .
we have a comic problem . we have `` level to the <unk> , '' <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want to all invite you to share this game with young people , all over the world , in the world , in the world , who managed to be able to spend social to help the world .
i 'll go to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think about it as next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we have n't yet saved the real world .
well , i hope that they are confident that the players are human resource to be able to use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for transformation .
we have all these superpowers together , <unk> , who works , narrow social networks , and <unk> and the desire to <unk> meaning .
i really hope we play together with great play , to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you will design and play with me like this .
so , when i first <unk> back to the next decade , i 'm sure that we can create a <unk> future , and that we can play all sorts of games .
so i say , let me start with play <unk> .
thank you .
i would like to tell you something like this a few months ago , i 'd notice you know , in a photo , i would have noticed a painting for a brush painting .
i always writing my <unk> , but i was the <unk> , and i realized that i was never in my life , which the word `` disabled '' really means .
i 'll read you the post .
affirmative `` <unk> '' : `` <unk> , washing , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
<unk> : healthy , strong , <unk> . ''
i took this list of a friend of read , and i had to wait for , it was so ridiculous , but i had to read and stop , and had to read and to stop reading and stop on the <unk> <unk> and led to <unk> emotional shock .
of course , this was a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> . i just thought that the cartoon must be quite old .
but in fact , it was a replica of the early 1980s when i started to go to the school with school , and i started to build my life outside of my family environment , and also in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me .
and god is a very careful system , i did n't use it .
if i was born with this post seriously , i would have a person who would perceive me as a person whose life in a <unk> situation can be positive , but today i 'm going to have to have a chance to the opportunity and adventure i 've been .
so i immediately looked at the <unk> of 2009 , and i expected that i found a <unk> .
here 's the <unk> version of this <unk> .
now , the argument is not much better .
in particular , i 'm talking about the last two words under `` lean nets '' `` the '' '' `` all of the time '' and `` healthy . ''
but it 's not just about words .
it 's about what we think about people who describe to these words .
it 's about the values that stuck in this words , and how we can build this values .
our language is what we think of the world and how we think about ourselves around us .
many landlords societies , including the greeks , and the <unk> , and they really believed that the <unk> of a <unk> was a big force , because that 's what you can also have an interesting force .
so , what do we want to do -- a human people or a human human condition ?
in just a people who spends people as a child , would be done , they would be inclined to catch and start with them .
would n't it be nice to open up ?
a human being sent to me , was my birth of it was a rabbit , and i had a name center in <unk> .
he 's called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , as you can think , most americans could n't get hurt , you know , you 're called dr. <unk> .
and dr. <unk> she was always very colorful by accident , and was just how to do with kids like materials .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just amazing -- until my <unk> .
i had to use individual exercises with this heavy , <unk> <unk> -- in various colors -- that you know , i hated it , and i hated it .
and imagine , i even already as a <unk> child with dr. <unk> , and so on , these approaches , were without succeeding .
and one day , he came to a place where i practiced , and he 'd seen it , and he said to me , `` wow , <unk> , you 're so a strong , <unk> and young girls , you 'll tear one of these down .
and if you can make it , i 'll give you a hundred dollars . ''
and , of course , that was just a simple trick of dr. terrorism , so i wanted to make the exercises that i did n't do with the prospect that mayors <unk> girl in the hospital in the hospital in the <unk> in the present bed , but he actually turned out to see my daily <unk> with new eyes . that 's how it was a new and <unk> experience .
and i wonder , today , how much his vision is being shaped as much , and <unk> young girl has shaped and i could imagine , as a result from strong , powerful and <unk> .
that 's just one example of many , how adults can be able to make adults in a <unk> group .
but how much of this already made examples of the <unk> , you have n't seen our language , we do n't think something that we would all want to see , to enable it to be a human person .
our language is the social changes behind the social changes , and what happened in many cases of the world .
from the medical standpoint of looking at all of you , of course , my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> from titan and artificial <unk> for the world 's <unk> for the world that people allow , really , all their own possibilities , and at the borders , they allow a strict identity , and at the world , to have the level of the world that they choose to .
so , maybe this technology change is true because the way that there was a different truth , which is that every human ability to be a little bit of <unk> and very , very concise , and that the human ability to adapt , our biggest one is plus our biggest food plus is .
human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to talk about with infinite , and i 'm going to get you very quickly with you to answer , and i think , i understand why .
this sentence from introducing environmental lives in terms of physical people , that success or happiness depends on a challenge without being challenged to the experience , but when my life is so successful , because i could perceive the possible fall of a life with a <unk> or whatever people could perceive me with my disability .
but the truth is that we 're changing , of course , we are in the challenge , whether they 're physically , emotionally or even both .
and i 'm assuming that is good .
there are no barrier that we have to anticipate , to be able to get better to our lives .
transitional number is simple to our lives .
and i 'm also being leaning into that shadow .
and i realized , i realized , he 's very carefully , sometimes he 's always going to see , but he 's constantly in me .
and i want to do that , i want to do the impact , the heavy of the human race , a man .
there 's basically <unk> and challenges , and they 're just luxurious in real , and every person walks to it . but the question is not <unk> , whether we 're not going to be with infinite , or not , but we 're clear .
so we 're not just responsible , people who love to preserve it , but they also have to get to it , well , good to it .
and we do n't think of our children if we give them feel that they do n't want to be able to adapt .
you have to separate two things : to be a medical fact , a <unk> and to the other point that i 'm not disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real real real real estate and a brand , i want to put together with the first thing that i had to put together , is that the world is all the case , and i could describe myself with this one .
in our desire to protect us on heart , and you 're the cool , hard truth about their medical sector , or even a retirement to life that they thought we do n't want to put us to our own point of that they 're in a disabled .
maybe this is what we 're in the process of that is what 's in the 1970s , and as we repair it , for every single one more connected than the drug of the drug .
if we do n't have to treat a human being , and not all of his forces and possibilities and recognize the natural struggle you might have to have , another disease .
we <unk> a human being , which is our society .
so we have to look at the root data and all of the land in human possibility .
but most importantly , it 's between perception of our transactions and our great social lives , a connection .
we should n't have a look at the time or we have experienced , we should n't try to avoid it , to avoid them , to avoid them under the carpet , but it 's about giving the probability opportunities .
and it 's really much more about taking me to think that we have to do n't necessarily get to priorities that we 're not necessarily going to overcome adversities , but that we 're open to the sound of a coffee and maybe even like that .
and maybe we can do it as a little natural , <unk> and useful to see and feel like the presence of the presence of the world 's presence .
in this year , we 're talking about the 200 grade in this year , and we celebrate the 200 darwin and when he wrote about 150 years ago , darwin has a very true , in my view , in something very true in the human character .
i would be so relieved it , not the most powerful of its way , and not the fact of its way , but the way that changes changes .
there 's a lot of conflict from conflict .
not just from doing the original work , we know the ability of the people , to survive and <unk> , from the battle of the human spirit , is moving through conflicts .
so , again , change and <unk> are the great ability to people .
and maybe we do n't know what the timber we are digging when we 're really going to get it eventually .
maybe that 's what makes sense of altruism , an perception of the world , it 's a sense of our own power .
we can be so ashamed of ourselves .
we can give confirmation a new meaning that 's going to be a very difficult times .
maybe we can see more density than change .
so based on the situation we have not adapted to us .
i think the biggest thing we have to have , is that we should be normal .
well , who 's normal ?
there 's no normal thing .
there 's the usual thing . the typical one . but not the normal . and you would have to know that , clean person , if you really have ?
i think it 's not .
it would be neat if we are able to get this paradigm of the normal versus another of the possibility or the strength , to be able to talk to the <unk> , to try and to talk to the forces of very many kids , and you can invite them to be able to apply to the very many kids , and they 're able to restore their very many things to be in society .
<unk> discovered that we have to have people who have the world 's increasingly , and we have a kind of to be useful and a contribution .
there 's some evidence that the comedy that already already exist in 60,000 years ago , people have had a <unk> pot , and that happened , because the life process of the human being in the people 's life is to be valuable .
they do n't have the broken and useless , they were being quite special and valuable .
a couple of years ago , i was in the town that was in the city where i grew up in the red zone , and i was standing there a little bit of the street .
it was summer and i had a look at the end .
and i hear what a guy told me , `` well , you know , that 's not <unk> . ''
and i 'm looking at it and see that dead man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , `` pardon , sir , do n't we ? i ca n't tell me . ''
and he said , `` well , you do n't really remember me .
and i saw her , i made her out of your mother . ''
oh , so that 's the thing .
and of course , it did n't have done .
this was dr. <unk> , a man i just from tales of my mother 's tales , because i knew it 's very typical , and i would have had to get late at my birthday two weeks .
the doctor 's red-haired student my mother was in vacation , and so i had the man who brought me into the world , at all , at all .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet came to them , and i just had a couple of toes on this and some exotic toes on this and a few times at the other foot , he had the sob who had to be the bad news .
he said , `` i had to tell her parents that you would never walk , and never like other kids , or that you never live a stranger and she 'd ever be used to make me lying . ''
and really extraordinary , i found that he had a whole bunch of time , no matter whether i had a fellowship to the <unk> , i could n't have had my fellowship to the <unk> , and he was using these clips to teach his students from the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> the x factor , the potential of human beings .
it 's just not enough to be the way you can be in the way that this particular factor of quality of the quality of the people can be .
and dr. <unk> said he said , `` i learned that kids , if you did n't have a little bit of the support when you were kids , then you can reach a lot . ''
you see , dr. <unk> has changed his way .
he had understood that medical diagnosis and how somebody do n't mean , two different things .
and i 've been thinking about time when i had asked me to imagine 15 years ago , i would have had to have a broken and bone , i would have n't have a second second .
i wanted to make a very normal way of that time .
if you ask me today , i 'm not quite sure .
and that 's happened because i 've experienced something with my legs and not despite this experiences .
and maybe this change could happen , because i have so many people who have opened me open , instead of people who have open me , who would give me , or give me a notion of the notion .
you see , it 's really just one of the people who show you how to interpret your powers , and they 're in .
if you can make someone your own , inner forces , to activate the force -- the human spirit is so <unk> -- if you can do that , and for somebody in a critical moment a door , you 're going to open up these people 's very good teachers .
they get them to open doors .
the real meaning of the word `` the word '' is `` <unk> . ''
it means to be something to be a potential to do that .
again , what the potential do we want to do ?
in the '60s , in britain , a <unk> school was done in the 1970s , and then they were getting into <unk> .
they call that `` the <unk> , '' in the united states , we call this as `` the `` idiot . ''
students are going to run the challenge for grades .
and the best , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , the better teachers and so forth .
they then have a <unk> period , and they have `` potentially '' the note `` very good , '' they 're told you , they 're very smart , and after these three months , they really wrote a <unk> .
and of course , it 's to hear the heart that the <unk> was told they 're just enough .
and just a few months , it was the three months .
but only those who were in school -- apart from the students who had paid the school .
so , in fact , the teachers was in the study that teachers were n't <unk> .
the teachers did n't know that something changed .
they were just told that the time that the students were doing , and they are the students who are doing , and they 're treated them .
the only real disability is a thing that has broken a mind , which has broken , has no hope . it does n't get any hope . it 's nothing beautiful . it 's missing our natural , psychological curiosity . and our innate ability to the ability of the imagination .
but if we can design it to support the human mind , to hope , to hope , to connect itself and other people around us to find it and then , then we 're going to get the skills to get a positive .
so if a spirit about these qualities is what we can do a new reality and new <unk> .
i want to end up with a poem that 's been <unk> by a poet poet named <unk> <unk> , and the poem is `` the god who only four words , '' `` every child knows god , not the god of the name , but the god who just did n't know the god of the name , but the god who only has four words and all the time he refuses , he always says , `` come , dance with me . ''
come on , dance with me . thank you very much .
