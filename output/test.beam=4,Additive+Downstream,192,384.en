when steve lopez , one of the los angeles times , one day through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an anthropologist , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , who played on a violin , only two earlier .
many of you will know the story , because from <unk> articles , later , later , a book that has been flattened with robert <unk> brothers , which was <unk> , and jamie <unk> as a <unk> anthony <unk> , which was <unk> , who was the most congressman studied , and she had a very popular career in a <unk> event .
so , <unk> <unk> , he had a <unk> and 30 years later , he lived as a <unk> on the streets of <unk> at the center of a <unk> row in the center of the <unk> at the center of los angeles .
and i assure you all to read , <unk> book , to read the movie , so you do n't just understand the wonderful journey between those two men , but also , how the music is creating this connection between those two men , but also , how the music allows these connections and how they finally had the instrument , the <unk> , the way of the street .
i met <unk> <unk> in 2008 , two years ago in the nfl disney hall hall hall hall .
he just had a demo of <unk> first and <unk> who heard the stage and came behind the stage .
and he talked to a very drunken and <unk> sound about his yo-yo ma and hillary clinton , and about how the dodgers never did n't in the united print , and that all of the sudden segment of the first rib from <unk> 's fourth symphony .
we came to the theme of music . and a couple of days later , i received an email , in the state that i was interested in my state , and i was interested in it .
i still have to say that this is a medical treatment , because he was already with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , a trauma that has made him his whole life .
so as a result , it 's now consolidated to these molten communities , and they 're sometimes so bad , and he 's sitting away , in the streets of <unk> and <unk> , and that he kind of crashed his own mind .
and in this case , a lot of time when we first had the first talking of our first subjects in the <unk> desert hall hall , and he had this persistent breath in his eye and was totally lost .
he talked about invisible leaders and smoke and about how someone would poison poison .
i had fear , not a freak , but i had scared that he could be , that he could be able to hit the relationship with the violin , and that i could continue to disrupt the relationship , when i started talking about mysticism and <unk> and other exciting ,
so i started to play .
i was playing the first phrase <unk> <unk> .
and as i was playing , i noticed that there was a <unk> change on this .
it was as if he stood under the impact of an invisible drug , a chemical reaction that was going to become my game .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> himself , in understanding , in a quiet curiosity and <unk> .
and as a miracles , he took his pat and started looking for some clips of <unk> and asked me to play with them .
we then then started talking about music , starting to talk about <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> .
and i realized that he 's not just an anesthetic knowledge about music , but he also had a close personal relationship with it .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i was only just about my colleagues in the crash of los angeles .
by looking at music and talk about music was out of this <unk> , ritual man , who was only in the streets of los angeles , it was a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in <unk> <unk> musicians .
music is medicine . it 's changed us .
for <unk> , music means music .
because the music allows him to his thoughts and weight with help his imagination and creativity .
and so he <unk> his <unk> .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
and this is why we 're doing music : so we 're doing something that 's what we 're doing , so that 's what we 're doing is in all of us , our emotions , through our artistic lens of content .
and the reality is that we all belong to us , and move , and it moves us together .
and what passed was doing so put him back into a community of friends .
and the <unk> force of music took him back to a family of musicians who understood his talent and it was painting .
and i 'm going to play again with shocking music , no matter of the <unk> salon in the <unk> hotel shop hall hall hall hall hall hall hall hall , chile , because he remembered me why i have become musicians .
thank you very much .
bruno giussani : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something i 'm going to stolen the <unk> .
i hope you excuse me .
so i have a lot of fish in my life .
i only loved two loved .
that first one , that 's more like a passionate scientist .
it was a nice fish , <unk> , good use , <unk> , a book on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , it was going to be inspired by the world 's largest standards of sustainability .
so you could be able to sell him .
i had a relationship with several months .
one day , the head of the company , and i asked if i could say , in an event , about the sustainability of the farm .
of course , i said .
here was a company that was trying to figure out what this kind of needs problem is to improve , how do we keep procrastinating in our <unk> ?
over the last 50 years , we 've downloaded the ocean leaders as we 've collected forests .
it 's hard to <unk> destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , they have collapsed .
it 's almost nothing left .
so i think that 's going to be <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
a lot of the things that are happening . <unk> infections the environment , most of you , and they 're inefficient , and it 's inefficient , and a big disadvantage .
he has a cassette from 15 to one .
that means to be 15 pounds of <unk> , so you need to get a pound .
not very sustainable .
never tastes very good .
so this was a company that tried to make it right .
i wanted to supported it up .
the day before the event , i called the head of the ministry of the company .
let 's call it .
`` rosy , '' i said , `` just to have the facts , you 're famous for this , so it 's out there in the ocean that you do n't solve the environment . ''
`` that 's true , '' he said . `` we 're so far out of the waste of our fish being distributed . ''
and then he put it , `` we are basically a spiritual world .
and this <unk> of <unk> at one , he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
<unk> to one , great .
`` dig one thing ? what do you do ? ''
`` sustainable proteins . ''
`` great , '' i said . put on .
and in this evening , i was in bed and thought , what about hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just before the event , i call .
i said , `` okay , what are sustainable proteins ? ''
he said he does n't know . he 's gon na go .
well , i <unk> with a couple of people in the company . nobody could give me an answer for me to go to the roaring biologist .
so let 's call it to the war .
`` welcome , '' i said , `` what 's sustainable proteins ? ''
well , he called some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , `` <unk> . ''
i said , `` pardon ? ''
he said , `` yes , bang , skin , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . ''
i said , `` well , how much percent attendance ? ''
in the assumption , maybe two percent .
`` well , that 's about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , `` well , what 's useful to provide chicken ? ''
there was a long time , and he said , `` well , there 's too much chicken on the planet . ''
i 'm <unk> myself from this fish .
no , not , because i 'm a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that 's actually me .
no , i 've got a <unk> of this fish , because , i swear to god , the fish jumps after chicken .
that second fish , that 's a different kind of <unk> .
it 's the romantic way to you , the better you learn your fish , you know .
i first <unk> him in a restaurant .
a <unk> journalist had spoken for a long time ago .
it has a bit of <unk> .
he came on the table with a bright , almost white color .
the pc chef had <unk> him .
shut twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can taste a fish so good after he was born ?
i ca n't , but this guy can .
let 's call it miguel . actually , he 's miguel .
and no , he 's not running the fish , and it 's not a chef . at least in the way that they understand .
he 's a biologist with <unk> <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> forests .
it 's near the <unk> of the river river .
to the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of <unk> .
they were <unk> out of what they were in the setting .
they made it by infinitely the country .
and they built the complicated result of famine , and they were pushing water from the land and they came out into the river .
well , they could n't make that work , not so economically .
and it was a catastrophe .
it took about 90 percent of the birds around what to be many birds .
and this is how a spanish company has bought the country .
what did they do ?
they have the river of the water .
they literally have the levers .
instead of doing the water , they used the channels back to the water again .
they are the channels .
and they created a <unk> of <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a shrimp -- and then the environmental environmental trajectory was completely different .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you 've never seen this thing .
they 're looking out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see are <unk> channels and <unk> , <unk> march .
i did n't have long time there .
he 's an extraordinary guy , three parts of charles darwin and part of `` a crocodile to kiss . ''
okay ? there we were , and we went to the wetlands , and i <unk> and <unk> , and i stuck on my knees , and i swear to a <unk> .
here he takes a rare <unk> .
now , he said the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , he 's looking at a pattern of <unk> that reminded him to the <unk> .
it turns out that miguel has spent the biggest part of his career in <unk> national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national park in africa .
i asked him how to become a <unk> .
he said , `` you know ? about fish .
i 'm an expert for relationships . ''
and then he goes down , and it goes into more sensitive birds and algae and funny .
and i 'm not being wrong with me , which was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community , so in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was turned out of this <unk> piece of delicious fish that i had on .
and so i did it . i said , `` daddy , how come to your fish ? ''
he showed up the algae .
`` i know , the algae , the relationships , the relationships , that 's incredible .
but what do you think ?
what is the <unk> ? ''
well , he 's looking at me to tell me that it 's such a collective system , that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
the profits correspond , the phytoplankton , the <unk> , that 's what the fish represents .
the system is so healthy , it 's totally incorrect .
there 's no food .
the one of a farm is n't that animals ?
later on day , i went up to this site with miguel <unk> , and i asked him , and i said , `` well , for a place that is such as obvious as a farm , where i ever had , `` how do you know ? ''
at the moment , it was like a robot would have been a <unk> .
and we bow around the corner , and we offered a lot of thousands of them , thousands and thousands of fellow organisms , a literally vivid carpet , so far as it is enough .
`` that 's success , '' he said .
`` look at your <unk> , pink .
she <unk> . ''
telegraph ? i was totally disturbed .
i said , `` `` i 'm sorry , do n't you have your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> .
now last year , on this site , birds birds , over 250 different kinds of species .
it 's today 's greatest and one of the major <unk> <unk> in europe .
i said , `` i said , is a good blank does the last thing you want to do ? ''
he gets off his head , no .
he said , `` we 're building <unk> . ''
this is a distributed network .
they were attacking the <unk> .
now , the indian food eat the directions .
so the truth in your belly the better system is the system . ''
okay , so let 's think this . a farm that does n't sit into your animals , and a farm that thinks their own success at the lung health .
one <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , you should not even have seen that view of familiarity .
they 're <unk> , in a city of <unk> miles away , where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning they 're spending 54 miles to farm .
and every night they fly 54 miles .
they 're doing that because they can retrace the <unk> white line .
all right .
i had a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked forward .
i said , `` miguel , fly to 20 miles of the square , and then you 're going to fly over the night ?
do you do that for the children ? ''
and he looked at me like that i had a song from a song from providence .
he said , `` no . you make it better . ''
i did n't know the skin of my beloved , the <unk> was delicious , and i do n't like <unk> . i do n't like it .
it 's this <unk> , <unk> flavor .
i just like to do that .
and yet , when i put her in this restaurant , it did n't have <unk> <unk> .
and they liked sound and in a position of the oceans .
i 'm called it to my agency , and he <unk> .
he said , `` the skin seems a <unk> .
it 's the last one before something in the body .
she 's designed by evolution to <unk> <unk> . ''
and then he put it , `` but our water did n't have <unk> . ''
okay . one farm that does n't ask her , a farm that measures their success at the success of their birth .
and then i realized when he says , a farm that has no <unk> , he <unk> it <unk> by the river river in the river .
it 's a river that is all of the things that are leading out of where rivers technologies tend to be in order to run chemical pollutants , from <unk> .
and when it comes through system , and it 's the water that 's warmer .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so , not just a farm that does n't give your animals , not just a farm that is literally a <unk> , and not just for those fish , but also for you and me .
because if the water goes off , it <unk> in the atlantic .
a drop of the ocean , i know , but i 'll take him , and i embrace it , because these <unk> , as well as she 's gone , it 's also morbidity .
you might say they 're a recipe for the future , whether we 're talking about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need to do is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one of one , where food is good .
but there 's a little too radical .
we 're not luxuries , we <unk> . we 're lover .
we love eye-popping . we love little <unk> . we talk about regional food . we eat more organic .
and if you say that the future , the future , someone gets somewhere on and say , `` hey , people , i love pink flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? ''
can i be honest ?
i do n't like that question .
no , no , because we 're producing enough calories to feed the world more than just feed .
one billion people will be sending today .
a billion -- this is more than ever before -- because of <unk> trends in the distribution , not the <unk> .
well , i do n't like this question , because they have the logic of the logic of the last 50 years .
take grain of grain at <unk> , <unk> on <unk> , chemicals on the earth , and the whole time has been saying , `` if we feed more people , how bad can this happen ? ''
this was the <unk> . it was the place . it was the u.n. director of the american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a <unk> in <unk> , a stakeholder , which is the fast of capital , which is the same amount of production .
that 's not a role , and it 's not agriculture .
we are now under threat today , not because of <unk> resources , but because of <unk> resources .
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through a country , not by ice , but through fresh water , not by <unk> , but through forests in the ocean .
you want to feed the world ?
let 's start with the question : how are we feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that enable us to feed themselves ?
in order to do that , do n't look for the future for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and machines and machines and machines are <unk> , and it has never been something really good for food .
let 's look at the environmental model .
that 's what runs on two billion years .
if you look at miguel farmers like miguel .
businesses who are not innate for the worlds , businesses , the representation rather than <unk> , business , the <unk> or the <unk> , the more expensive , the more expensive , the more expensive , the more expensive , the more expensive , the more youthful , the more expensive , the more youthful , the more expensive , the more youthful , the more expensive , the more youthful , the more expensive , the more youthful , the more youthful , the more expensive ,
because they are the people who are experts too .
and if i really become honest , they 're a better chef than i 'll be .
you know , that 's right because if the future of good food is to be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to convey one thing today , it 's that the whole of the data that we consume is , as the sum of the parts , and instead of thinking to explore , i want to think about how we can use information , that they can think about how we can use information , that they can think about how we can use information , that they can think about how we can use information , that they can be the way we can use information , and we 'll notice that they were n't visible .
so , what we 're seeing here is a typical line point to old .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it 's <unk> , and what i can do with pet pet is that i can filter for a certain language , let 's face .
and immediately , i see a different pattern .
and it 's because in the <unk> here , the people will be on the <unk> , and they 're over here .
we can continue one step further and start that data , and you see that <unk> and cancer is the common suspects , but not for everybody .
now , if we continue to go further , we say , 40 years or younger we have to see 40 years , or younger we have to see that weight should be worrying about people .
and who <unk> it is especially of men .
so what you see is that the view of information and data in this kind of remembered a lot of swimming in the form of a life .
and if we do this for wireless wireless policy , why do n't make the content themselves ?
what we have here today are the most popular people here , every single one of the world <unk> era , which have ever been shown .
it 's all right here . it 's all online .
you can test it to my talk .
you can get them in a decade .
they can get into a certain year .
you can jump to a certain extent .
now , if i look at here , i can see the dials that appear in that video games and the appropriate room .
i 'm a proud of armstrong 's fan , so i 'm going to say that what i 'm supposed to show you in the strange armstrong
now , if i only want to get a <unk> poster , i could think , `` okay , what if i 'm looking at everything about this subject ? ''
so i 'm going to go back a step back and <unk> .
now , greg <unk> .
and so you get a sense of that , if you put on this sort of information , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you do n't look or not just <unk> .
you do something that 's actually a little bit different .
it 's something in between , and we think about how information can be used .
so i want to take this idea a little further with something a little bit crazy .
what we 've done here is , we have every single browser <unk> , and they reduce a little summary .
the summary contains a short and a symbol for the domain of it .
i 'll just show you the top 500 of the <unk> .
but even in this conceptual view , we can do a lot of things .
once we get a sense of the things that are most of the wikipedia at the high school .
i 'm going to choose the subject .
now , after i took <unk> ' elected , i know , the <unk> that are most likely most of this is the most vulnerable thing in the year , `` humans . ''
this is really important , because this is an insight which is not in one of the individuals .
that 's just one thing if you go one step back , and all of it looks like .
it 's a certain one point of this sensor , and i can think about the theme of the year , and everybody together .
now , if i know all of these individuals , i know the majority of these are <unk> . some of them come from the science . some of the things come from the economy . there 's my boss .
interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
so we can jump on , and i 'm looking at every ted prize winner .
you can see , we are surfing on the web , the first time it 's a net , not just one , it 's a lot more abstract .
and i want to show you what else might be a little surprise .
i 'm just showing you the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i do n't want to call it a browser . it 's really not browser , but you can look at this <unk> to every single website like this .
so i can go back to a very specific note .
that 's why it 's so important , because it 's just a way that 's just through the way that you can look at this sort of place in this way , and that 's why it can look at the same way .
so i can zoom in a certain way .
here 's the state of the entire demonstration i grew up .
and i can look at what i 've been looking at today , again .
and then , when i jump back to a step , and i can look at everything , i can zoom in my mind after i 'm going to go back to my <unk> . here , here , i wanted to point out to be <unk> here , and here you live to live for <unk> .
and from here i can come in the page and get them back .
it 's a metaphor that 's used again , and every time it makes the g20 as the sum of the <unk> .
in the moment , in the world , we think data is a curse .
we 're talking about the oscar curse .
we 're talking about `` stay in information . ''
what if we could turn that situation and the internet on the top and the internet on the top , so we always have to go from one to the other things , start to go from a lot of things to many things and find patterns that otherwise might have happened ?
if we can do this , then these things are going to be <unk> , maybe a new source of that kind of information .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can know .
and when we learn to know , then we can actually figure out of it .
so i 'm listening to thank you very much .
i grew up with a <unk> of science fiction fiction fiction .
i went to school with the bus to school every day ,
and my nose was always in a book , a <unk> , which my thoughts was <unk> in other worlds , and in a <unk> way , my deep reflection in my own worlds , in a <unk> way , my deep thoughts in other worlds , and in a <unk> way , my deep thoughts in the other worlds , i think , i think , incredibly curiosity .
now , this curiosity , i always showed that if i was n't in high school , i went through the forests and the samples , frogs and snakes and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop and pop
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was all about trying to understand the world and the limitations of possible .
and my love of science fiction fiction is in my surroundings , because at the time , in the late '60s , we went to the moon and the deep sea .
jacques <unk> came into our living room , which animals and places full of wonders that we could never have imagined .
well , that 's what it has been doing with the <unk> theorem .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint paint .
and there 's neither video games that <unk> with me now film the whole notion of the media landscape , i had to create pictures in my head .
we had to all of that time . so if we started to read a book , we took the description of the <unk> , and we turned them to the screen in our heads .
my response to that was drawing and paint from aliens , aliens worlds , robots , and all that .
in an act , i was constantly going to get away from the teacher , like i was <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
the creativity had somehow somehow get out .
and it happened something interesting . what i was looking at jacques <unk> , which was the idea of a completely unfamiliar world on earth .
certainly i would never reach a <unk> world with a spaceship , which seemed pretty unlikely .
but there was a world that i could actually hit in the earth , and she was as fascinating and exotic , like all this , what i had imagined when i was trying to read these books .
so i decided when i was 15 .
the only problem is that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles from the nearest ocean .
and i did n't let <unk> .
i <unk> my dad until he finally had a <unk> in <unk> , new york , woke up , just on the other side of where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in the winter , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , only two years later to california .
since the 40 years , we have spent about three hours of water , 500 hours of that in <unk> .
and i learned that the world of the deep deep , even in the most vulnerable ocean , so rich in life is so rich , how we really ca n't imagine .
we do n't know the imagination of nature , regardless of our own , human imagination .
until today , i think of my deepest awe for what i see on my <unk> .
and my love to the ocean is taking the same intensity of the ocean and the people .
when i was an adult intern , as an adult <unk> , it was <unk> .
and that seemed to be the best way to create my inner tales , with my need to create pictures .
and as a child , i was eating out and <unk> and stuff .
so , movies were the way , images and stories , and that fit together .
and of course , the stories i was <unk> out of the <unk> , `` terminator , '' and `` <unk> . ''
in `` <unk> , '' i could <unk> my <unk> for the <unk> and the <unk> .
so my two loves my two passions .
something interesting happened in this movie -- and we had to create a kind of liquid <unk> , <unk> , back .
and what came out of it was the first to <unk> that was in a movie .
now , the movie was no money , it just seemed to put his software system , but i realized something fascinating : the audience around the world was <unk> of the magic ,
according to arthur <unk> , the world 's law are more powerful technology , and therefore no longer separate from each other .
so you saw something magical .
and that was what i found was exciting .
and i was like , `` wow , this must be done in the <unk> . ''
so we went to `` the `` two two , '' my next film , even more .
together with <unk> water , we put on the guy from liquid metal , and the success was pushing out of what this effect would be .
and it worked . again , we had something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same thing .
from these two experiences , a whole new world was reached a whole new world of creativity .
so i set up a company together with my good friend of mine , who was the best <unk> , and <unk> , she was called digital skies .
the main idea of this organization was that it 's the stage <unk> process with visual <unk> , etc .
and that 's what we did , and then we get a conscious spot .
but at the end of the 1990s , we discovered that we had <unk> and <unk> -- what we were actually started -- too , slowly .
i had a piece called `` avatar , '' which was the sort of visual effects and <unk> of effects in all new heights of a human , <unk> characters that were made by <unk> , and the world should be <unk> .
but they told me all back , and the people in my company told me that we do n't be able to create that .
so i shifted this , and i made this other movie above the big ship , the hood .
and then i sold this as `` ideal and juliet to a ship , '' it was sold a <unk> <unk> , a greek film .
but in fact , i wanted to resist the real ticket of the titanic .
so i did the movie .
that 's the truth . the studio did n't .
but i convinced them , by saying , `` we look at the dials . we 're going to go to the real house .
we 're going to show it in the center of the movies .
it 's beautiful . it 's a good news for marketing . ''
and i <unk> them , an expedition .
sounds crazy . but that 's coming back to what your imagination can create .
we then then , six months later , a reality where i was living in a russian <unk> university , four miles below the surface of the north atlantic , and i was making the real-life titanic by a <unk> .
that was n't a movie , no paperwork , that was real .
so that 's really blew me .
and the amount of it was extraordinary . we had to build cameras and services and everything .
and i realized , like this <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
well , they were <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
you go into this mountain , you 're going to push into this dark , hostile environment , where no hope is to rescue , if you do n't go back to it .
and i thought , `` wow , that 's just as if i was in a <unk> .
that 's really cool . ''
i was obsessed with studying the deep sea .
anyway , from the part , with curiosity and science , it was all . it was , it was , it was , it was like , it was like .
and it was an experience that i gave up to hollywood .
because , you know , i could think of a creature that we could make visual worlds , but i could n't even think of what i would see outside of this thing .
in some of the 2014 , i 've seen creatures in <unk> , and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things before , and that 's when we saw them when we saw them , i had n't found anything else .
so that 's really <unk> me , and i wanted more .
and so i met a little unusual choice .
after the success of `` titanic , '' i said , `` okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker , hollywood to hollywood on ice and i 'll be <unk> for a while . ''
and then we started , we arrived , and we made them with <unk> .
we went to the flight of the titanic .
we took little little robot that we were built , which was a <unk> device .
and our intention was to look at the inside of the ship , which never had done before .
nobody had the inside of the welfare system . you do n't have any means . so we developed the technology .
well , i 'm sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and look at the <unk> band there ,
and i just <unk> through a little tour through the corridors of the ship .
but i 'm just showing it , but my mind is within the inside .
it felt like i was going to physically physically within the center of the titanic .
this was the <unk> form of a <unk> that i ever ever have .
and the set of it was a really replica of the box of the ship .
so this was highly strange experience .
she made me realize that they use such <unk> credit , and so their consciousness in the vehicle , in these other form of existence .
it was really quite profound .
and maybe a little look at what might happen in a few decades , when you have <unk> , to explore things , or other things i can think of as a <unk> .
after that , what we began to do was , what we 've seen at the bottom , really appreciate , for example , these <unk> animals . these are the ones , but here on earth .
they 're living with their help .
they do n't exist in the sunlight , so we do that .
and that 's how you see animals that will be right next to a 500 degrees celsius that they can survive .
at the same time , i was also interested in a while that was one of my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people that are interested in space and to do it with nasa , and in the <unk> , and they 're driving to russia , through the mission , the <unk> trading affected , and turn , and then they 're <unk> ,
that was amazing .
but at the end it turned out , i took <unk> with us in the deep ocean .
and i took them up to the world , and i took them to access to the world , like , <unk> , <unk> , people who were interested in the extreme environments , so i took them to the sources of the sources , so they would take samples and instruments and instruments and so forth .
and we used to have the case , but we were actually science science , more importantly , <unk> .
that 's the result between my existence as a <unk> , as a child , and the cornerstone in reality .
and in the course of that , i have learned a lot .
i 've learned a lot of science , but i 'm sure you 're certainly , a director has to be a director like a stairmaster or something like that .
but i did n't understand much of leadership before i <unk> these things .
because at some point i had to say , `` what do i do here ?
why do i do this ? what is going on ? ''
these <unk> movies do n't make money .
we just play the creation . there 's no embarrassment .
all think i think of `` titanic , '' and `` avatar , '' and i would have <unk> your leg on a cloth .
i 've all made those films , this is a very small audience .
no reference , no honor , no money , what are you doing ?
you 're doing it in the task , and the ocean is the <unk> environment , which are there , you 're doing it in the <unk> , and because of the strange bond , that 's going to be a little group of people .
because we 've done this with just 10 to 12 people that have been done for years , and sometimes we were two to three months at sea .
and in the community , you can notice that the most important thing that you have , because you have a job that you could n't explain any other .
if you had to land on land and say , `` we had to do it , the rate , the <unk> , and all the difficulty , the whole technology , and the difficulty , the whole technology , when you 're on the ocean , '' you can not explain the other . that 's like police or in soldier , that they have to be able to explain it .
there 's a connection that creates a connection .
so when i came back to turn my next movie `` avatar , '' i tried to apply the same cancer system , which is that you have to use that person , and you would get into your memory .
it became really changed by the dynamics .
so here i got back to a small team on the heavy-duty terrain , and we used `` solomon '' with a new technique that was n't there .
it 's exciting .
a huge challenge .
and we became a period of close to a <unk> and a half years ago .
it 's changed my way to make movies , completely .
there was people who said , we would have really gotten these <unk> well , really , on the planet .
for me , it was more than me , more than my job , the actual process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we close from all of that ?
so what ? lessons have we learned ?
i think of first , the curiosity .
it 's the most powerful human quality .
and our imagination is a force , which is actually a reality .
and the second of your team is more important than all of the world 's world 's top of the world .
i come to me , `` give me a advice like i can do something . ''
and i say , `` <unk> you .
they 're going to get some of you . do n't do it with yourself . they take risks on you . ''
nasa has this <unk> , `` failure is not an option . ''
but in art , in art , in art , in art , if you have to be an alternative , because there 's a game-changer .
it 's not an important thing , the innovation , the innovation was happening without the risk .
you have to be ready to take this risks .
that 's the idea i want to give you to the path . so failure is an alternative , fear but not . thank you .
today , i 'm talking about energy and climate .
and that 's surprising , because my inbox is dominated by the foundation of <unk> and seed , to make the things that we create , and we need to make better lives .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , so much more important for every other on the planet .
<unk> means that their three years is not being growing over many years . it 's a lot of it or too low , but things that are going to do so can transform the <unk> environment .
this leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , it 's going to be bad for you .
it 's also the key to make it very important .
in fact , if you could reduce one of the price of price , the price would be under the most effective .
well , the <unk> <unk> is the time time .
in fact , the <unk> construction is based on <unk> .
the <unk> of the world 's military revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was an elite case in the <unk> , and therefore we have to do modern materials and so many things .
so we 're in a wonderful situation with power in the rich world .
but , if we reduce the price -- let 's make it down to a new barrier , and this barrier is based on co2 .
co2 is the planet and the <unk> of co2 is actually quite clear .
they <unk> the <unk> co2 , which leads to <unk> , and these <unk> has a number of very severe influence . effects on the weather , and perhaps worse , which suggests that the natural ecosystems can not be able to adjust , and therefore , whole systems .
well , the exact image of this relationship between a <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and where the other are going to follow , and there 's some <unk> .
and there 's certainly more bad about how bad this impacts are , but they 're extremely bad .
and i asked the <unk> several times , `` have we got to get close to close to zero ?
do n't we have half or a quarter ? ''
the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will continue to rise .
and so it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different from saying , we have a explosive m of high truck under a three meter bridge .
this is a big move on zero .
well , we run a lot of <unk> , over 26,000 billion tons .
every single mile is about 20 tons , people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it 's about five tons for every on the planet .
and somehow we have to be able to get that down to zero .
it 's so far away .
only different economic changes that we have is affected and we need to go from <unk> increase in a reduction to zero .
this equation has four factors . it 's a little bit <unk> . you 've got this thing on the left -- co2 -- that they want to get zero to zero , and that will depend on the number of people , from the service , from the service , the average energy for every service and the co2 , which is a <unk> .
so let 's look at each other , and we think about how we 're going to get this on zero .
probably one of those numbers have to get very close to zero .
now , this is basically breast , but let 's go .
we have the population .
today , today 's now , more than more than today billion people .
and it 's starting to be 9 billion to move 9 billion .
if we could succeed , we could think about 10 percent to 15 percent , but at time , we have a quarter of 1.3 .
the second is the services we use .
it 's all the food we eat , clothing , television , heating .
these are very good things and <unk> meaning , these services almost almost on the planet .
it 's great that this number is going up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , in the upper billion , we could do it <unk> and less , but in the average , that number of every year , and you have more than double that are placed in the number of services per person .
so here 's a very serious service , where are there to be home with the homework ?
and these students do n't do it , so they 're reading their <unk> underneath the <unk> .
now , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there 's good news .
we have something that does n't happen .
because of different accidents in the <unk> , in other <unk> , through new methods , there 's a lot of employees that you have now reduce 90 percent .
in other places , like the creation of <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , is a very much smaller .
by all , if we 're optimistic , we might think about a factor of three or maybe even another .
but in the first three factors , we have gone from 26 billion , we 've gone to 50 billion tons .
so let 's look at the fourth amount of -- and this will be a <unk> -- that 's the amount of co2 that 's a <unk> .
it turns out the question is if you can get this on zero .
if you burn out of coal , you do n't .
when they burn natural gas , you do n't .
almost every <unk> of power of current , but renewables and <unk> .
so , what we need to do is to make a new paradigm .
we need collusion .
if i do use the word `` wonders '' i mean ,
it 's a wonder . the computer is a wonder .
the web and the health services is a wonder .
people here are contributed to many of these wonders .
normally there 's no such thing that you need a miracles to a certain date .
it 's normally that you 're just going to go out and some of them .
but in this case , we have to be <unk> and have a miracles in a very short time .
now , i wondered , how do i really <unk> this ?
is there a natural strategy , a demonstration that 's the idea of people here ?
i remembered that last year , when i took it , and somehow the people .
the idea was that they really relate to , you know , that there are people who are living with them .
for energy , i noticed this .
i decided that the stereotype of brazil would be to the environment .
so here are some natural religious .
you have told me that they do n't bite me . in fact , they do n't even leave the glass .
well , there 's all sorts of things like this , but not all of you do n't .
we need solutions , either one or several things have a broad scale and <unk> <unk> , and even though there 's a lot of directions that people look at , i really only have five to make this great need .
i have cooking , <unk> , <unk> and boxes .
now , you know , this may have a long contribution , and if you do better than i expect , the awesome , but my halo here is that we have to work on all of those five problems , and we ca n't give them from them because they have some serious issues .
let 's look at the burning of fossil fuels , burning of either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do is , you know , maybe , but it 's not . you would have to all of all the carbon dioxide that you have to burn out of that carbon , and you would have to do all of the carbon dioxide that you 're doing from that carbon , you know , under pressure and then you can put it somewhere and hope that there 's still one way .
there 's a few of them who are based on a 60 percent -- 80 percent globally , but it 's on 100 percent to get a very difficult , and the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who will make it ?
who can assure a little demo , what is literally a lot of times bigger than any kind of crap that you can think about mysticism and other things ?
that 's a lot of volume .
so this is a tough <unk> .
next next , clubbing .
they also have the three big problems . the cost , especially in <unk> countries , the question of security is that you really feel that nothing can be wrong , despite the human part that the fuel is not suitable for weapons .
and what do you do with the garbage ?
even though he 's not very high , there 's a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that may be solvable , and they should be working .
the last three of the five of the five is i 've been in .
it 's the renewables , they 're often called .
and even though it 's great that you do n't need any fuel -- they have some downsides .
one is the <unk> , which these technologies are generating dramatically lower than the <unk> .
these are nukaks , you talk about lots of <unk> , <unk> more land than a normal power .
and then the sources of the world trade .
the sun does n't seem to be the whole day , it does n't seem to be a day , and the winds are not always .
that 's why you have to take away from those sources , you have to have a way to get the energy in times if they 're not available .
so there 's a big <unk> . there are challenges in transmission . if we 're saying that the energy energy outside of the country is , they do n't need the technology , you have to deal with the risk that the energy from where it comes from .
and there 's a <unk> .
and to show the dimension , i have all sorts of batteries that are created for cars , computers , cell phones , cell phones , cell phones , cell phone , cell phone , cell phones , for everything . and that 's what i have to do with the amount of the electronic energy that we make , less than 10 minutes .
so we need a big breakthrough , something that 's going to be a factor of 100 times a factor of 100 better than that time .
that 's not impossible , but it 's not so easy .
this is what happens when you try to get these <unk> sources over 20 percent -- 30 percent of the rest of the rest .
if you want to end up 100 percent of them , they need an incredible pie .
now , where should we go , what 's the right approach ?
i mean , the average generation ? how come to target ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on this .
in each of these five areas we need to be at least 100 people .
you know , they 're nuts . that 's good .
i think in the ted group there are many things that are already there .
bill big has a number of companies under other things called the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies that are doing amazing things and interesting possibility and i try to support that .
nathan myhrvold and i have a company that , maybe surprisingly enough to do this .
there 's some major health in the <unk> ; <unk> , liquid .
development has gone in the industry in front of some time , so it 's not a great surprise that some good concepts have happened .
the <unk> means that you 're not on a part of the <unk> , which is one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent to burn .
that 's a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you had a long time about this , but you could never be able to do that , but you could never be able to do that , if it was modern supercomputer , you simulate it .
and because you burn these 99 percent , it 's a lot better .
in fact , you burn the garbage , and you can even use the waste of today , and you can use the waste of today .
instead of looking at it , you burn it . it 's a great thing .
the <unk> is inbuilt , a little bit like a candle .
and you can see that it 's a sort of a column , often as `` the other wave . ''
so this is what they really do .
here 's a picture of a place in kentucky .
that 's the waste that 's 99 percent , and you 've got this thing that 's now burned today , so it 's <unk> <unk> .
that 's the <unk> u.s. u.s. for hundreds of years .
and when you put <unk> cheap , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there 's many challenges , but it 's an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
think about how to measure our success .
what should our strategy look like ?
well , let 's go to the target we need to get to a meeting and we talk about the <unk> .
a lot of talk about a 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it 's really very important that we get there .
the rest 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and hopefully will be <unk> and cement .
so to reach this 80 percent , the world , including countries like china , their <unk> completely .
the other note , the other note , whether we use the most advanced technology , whether they 're in all developed countries , and we 're on the road to get them to the rest .
that 's great importance .
this is going to be a shift that <unk> .
if we go back from there , what should we look like ?
it has to contain the two elements .
we should use the programming system to bring the reduction on the road , the less we <unk> , the less less will be the <unk> and the temperature .
but actually , this note is the things that we hire businesses that are not fully to do , or even a little bit less important as the other thing that 's the basis of innovation to this story .
we have to track track , and we can measure them , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there 's lots of wonderful books to this topic .
al gore , `` we have the choice , '' and david <unk> `` <unk> , '' `` <unk> , '' the hot air . ''
they really go through and make a framework in which this can become broad , because we need for support for all sides .
there 's some things that have to come together .
that 's a wish .
now , a very common thing that we make this technology forward .
if you just take a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a polish , and i love that , or i could choose this wish that 's called <unk> <unk> without co2 . i wish i 'm going to take a wish .
that 's greatest impact .
if we 're not able to get this desire , it 's going to be terrible between the united states and the china and the china , between poor and the rich countries , and almost all of the lives of this two billion , very much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what do i do ?
we need to use more <unk> .
if countries are in places like <unk> , you should not talk about co2 .
you should be able to talk to the <unk> , and they would be shocked by the ridiculous times , which is repeated for these innovative innovative approaches .
we need collusion to use carbon dioxide , <unk> & amp things that make a <unk> .
we have to spread the news .
we have to be insanely and <unk> , and the things that are done by the government .
it 's a good wish , but i think we can meet it .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to be able to understand something better -- first of you , can you have a idea of magnitude of these investment ?
bill gates gates : so , to get the simulation on a supercomputer , all big scientists , what we 've done , we only need a few 10 million , and even if we have our materials into a russian reactor , to make sure that it works properly .
the difficult step is that the building of the first <unk> , to find another billion , the <unk> and the place that actually construct the first of it .
once the first one is , if it 's supposed to walk on this , it 's all clear , because the weather economy , the <unk> is so different than <unk> .
in order to make this right ? that means deep to build deep into the ground , almost like a <unk> of the nuclear <unk> , that <unk> , and then the process starts on to the bottom ?
bg : exactly . now , you have to have to get the reactor the reactor , so there 's a lot of people , and lots of them , and lots of them to go wrong , and that 's not good !
but if you have a very cheap fuel , you can do it for 60 years , if you think about a column -- they think of it , without all the <unk> .
and it 's sitting there and it 's done for 60 years .
a nuclear reactor , which is a solution for phosphorus .
bg : yes . well , what 's happening with the crap : you can leave it -- there 's less garbage with this method -- then you take it and put it in the next reactor and burn it up .
and we begin by using the waste that exists already , which is already in these <unk> or <unk> in the daytime .
so this is what we put on this reactors was a problem , which is what we put in our own , and it 's going to reduce it dramatically , as this process .
but while they 've talked about different people in the world about these possibilities .
where is the biggest interest , so what really does ?
bg : well , we have n't set up on a place , and there 's a lot of fun cooling for everything called `` nuclear '' '' `` nuclear '' '' `` nuclear '' '' in russia , in china , china -- i was here , and i talked about how this relates to the <unk> .
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something that 's made .
this is a nuance of one thing that was done .
so , this is a big step forward , but it 's like a faster reactor and some countries have been building this , so anyone who has a rapid reactor , a <unk> for our first .
in your idea , how do you really want to call the person in your life ?
bg : well , we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we 've got 20 years to the <unk> , 20 years .
that 's kind of the straw that demonstrated that we have to anticipate .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything is good , and that 's a big wish , it could be easy .
and luckily today , dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of them that , when they work , when they work , they work dozens of them , and when they work , they work dozens of people , and when they work , they work dozens of them , and when they work with the work , they can <unk> it .
and it would be on the best , if it can do multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
we need a solution to a solution .
now , the big <unk> breakthroughs , is the largest thing you know ?
bg : a <unk> is <unk> .
that would have been <unk> , but it 's really so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there is other innovative companies .
you know , we do n't know their work as well as good as these , but there 's the tuned way that 's another approach .
there 's a <unk> , which seems hard , but maybe that 's what we might say about us .
and so there are different superheroes , but the beauty of this is that it 's a million times a million times a million times a million times a million times a million times a million times a million times a million times a million times a million times a million times a million times a million times , say , a <unk> , and so if you can deal with the problems , and they 're mainly the radiation , the efficient and other things , almost in their own adventure .
if that works , what ?
do we have to use <unk> communication to keep trying to keep the <unk> stable ?
bg : if you come to this situation , it 's as if you 've gone too much past , and it 's a heart attack . what do you do then ?
there 's a <unk> <unk> called <unk> , which is taking together with multi-material techniques to delay the warming , so that we do 20 or 30 years longer .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope we do n't need .
some people say , you should n't be able to use the insurance , because you might have to be lazy because you know that one will save the density .
i do n't know if that 's smart , if you 're going to get the importance of this problem , but there 's a discourse in <unk> if you should have that , if things are going to happen , or that innovation takes longer than we expect .
<unk> : do you have one or two sentences for you to do ?
bg : well , sadly life is life in a very different place .
those of the scientific arguments are very little .
tell you that there are negative impacts that have to do with the clouds that have gone ?
there 's very , very few things that you can ever say , that there 's a chance a million .
so here 's as much as aids as aids .
you make a mistake now , and you pay for it very much later .
and so the idea now , if you have all sorts of <unk> problems in something that you 're just later -- and that 's because of the report report is not necessarily the worst possible scenario , and there 's people in the wealthy world , and they say , okay , that 's not a big deal .
the fact is that this uncertainty should be worrying about us .
but my dream here is that if you can harness it economic , and at the same time , the skeptics says , `` okay , it 's not a carbon dioxide , i wish it was cheaper than the previous method . ''
and that would be your response to the <unk> argument that if you used to solve all of this time and energy , to solve the carbon problem , all the other goals , the <unk> , the people who gets hurt by malaria , and so on , that there 's a dumb waste of resources to invest money while there 's better things we can do .
bg : well , the actual number of research -- say , the u.s. emissions should be 10 billion per year to spend today -- that 's not so dramatic .
it should not suffer any things that way .
you get to big <unk> , and you can get sensible people if you have something that 's not economic , and it 's trying to do it . it 's trying to be most of the waste .
it 's because it 's very short of a <unk> and funded , and i think we should have more things that have the potential to be very much cheaper .
if you get a very high school , you get a very high frequency , you can just keep the rich ones .
i mean , every one of us here might be five times as much for our energy to change .
for the top two billion , but it 's a disaster .
and even <unk> .
and his new <unk> is now , `` why is n't the research to worry about ? ''
he 's still still because of his earlier stories , with the <unk> , but he understood that this is a very rich group , and therefore he 's now <unk> .
and this is a piece that i think for appropriate .
the research is , it 's crazy ; it 's just nuts .
bill , i believe i am for almost any people here if i say , i really hope you 're going to be true . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , now , peter <unk> was a <unk> called `` the <unk> . ''
the idea is quite simple . it 's got to reduce the world <unk> structure with 20 <unk> , about <unk> .
the sound has to be on top .
and even though it 's really easy , it 's really hard because it 's people moving very quickly .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a <unk> .
it was a huge treat .
so since then , i was doing about 70 health across the world , with students , <unk> and architects , even with the <unk> , and there 's something about this task , which allows deep parenting in the nature of collaboration , and i want to share some of them .
normally , most people will get themselves about the task .
they talk about it , you think about what it is like , they 're <unk> .
and then they 're spending a little time into planning and organization , and it 's mostly <unk> .
they 're spending a lot of their time into the <unk> <unk> structures .
and finally , just before they have no time , someone puts the marshmallow , and they put him gently on the top , step back a step back and <unk> .
but , it 's almost always , it 's called `` <unk> , '' because the weight of the eyeball is that the whole thing will be like , and <unk> .
there 's a number of people who are much more `` <unk> '' than others , and among the worst are fresh .
they lie , they cheat , they 're confused , and they really are really <unk> structures .
and of course , there 's also teams have a lot more `` <unk> '' and among the best , new proportion of the <unk> .
and that 's pretty amazing .
as peter did not just do the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is : how come ? why ? why ? what ?
and peter 's saying , `` neither of the children 's spent time is the <unk> . ''
they do n't invest time in <unk> .
but there 's another reason .
and that is , <unk> are designed to find a right plan , ok !
and then you see it .
so what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you have no time and what happens ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what 's going to do is that they start to start with the marshmallow and they build prototypes , and at the top of the top , so they 're going to repair their way to repair .
<unk> these kinds of work as a core of a <unk> .
and with everyone trying to get the children , what works and what do n't .
that 's the performance of working with prototypes , but let 's see how different teams work .
the average of the average for most of them , most of them , the lawyers are better than adults .
who 's the most successful ?
architects and engineers , thankfully .
<unk> is the last highest thing i 've seen .
and why ? because they 're understanding and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to build stable structures .
eleven injuries is something about average . but here 's interesting .
if you multiply a <unk> administrator on the team , they 're getting significant significant .
it 's amazing . you look at it , and you can see , `` this team will win . ''
you can predict the future . why is that ?
because they have special skills of the fittest .
they 're running the process , you understand him .
and that team , the weight and on the work , the performance will improve improve .
playful skills and <unk> and their own ones .
if you have 10 teams , they get about six , you know , you know , you 've got robust structures .
and i tried something very exciting .
and i thought , let 's make the <unk> right .
so i asked a <unk> award for the winner .
what do you think about this <unk> ?
what was the result ?
that 's happened . not a team , a robust structure .
if someone had a holistic construction , it would have been <unk> .
so , is n't it interesting that high of the <unk> have a strong effect strong ?
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
so what do you think about ?
now you understood the advantage of the `` <unk> . ''
so , in the same , bad team of one under the best .
it 's the highest construction in the least .
there 's been <unk> lessons for us , and success .
you might ask questions , why would anyone get time to create a <unk> ?
the reason is , i make digital tools and processes to help teams , to help , video games and `` <unk> . ''
and what 's the <unk> , it helps them identify them apart .
because , frankly , it has its own signature .
the challenge is a common experience , a common language or <unk> , the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in , can come to visit .
it 's a blog where you can see how to build the marshmallow .
there 's a <unk> there .
they find crazy examples of all over the world , like people to optimize the system .
there 's also <unk> .
and the cynical lesson i think is that construction is actually a <unk> sports .
it will require that we 're all giving our senses on the task , and that we think of our emotions and our way , in the challenge , that 's what lies us .
and sometimes it 's a little prototype of this experience all of what it takes us from a `` <unk> '' moment `` <unk> . ''
and that can make a big difference .
thank you very much .
do we have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool machine machine , and that 's a time .
and everybody in this room has to be in .
and you can go into the past ; you ca n't go in here .
and i wonder what they 're going to vote , because i had a lot of my friends in the last last time , and they wanted to go to the past .
i do n't know . they wanted to go back to the time or twitter or the u.s .
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced that you 're somehow drawn to the success ,
and i understand that .
i am not part of this group , i have to say .
i do n't want to go into the past , and it 's not because i 'm an <unk> .
it 's because of possibilities on this planet do n't go back to the planet .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the biggest time that 's ever on this planet , no matter how scale they make sense : health , mobility , opportunities , <unk> .
there was a time like this .
my favorite nurse died when they were 60 .
my grandparents survived this number to 70 .
my parents are over 80 to these things .
so there was a nine at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it 's not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a kid that 's going to be born today to live as long as the richest man in the world , 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox , the smallpox have billion people on this planet .
you have the demographics of the earth in a way new , like no war .
they 're gone . they 're gone .
we have <unk> . it 's shaking .
in the rich world , diseases , millions of us only have an incomplete , not yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
does anybody know what this is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , that are successes of scientific technology .
and from my perspective , the scientific method to explore is how it works , it works when it works , it works when it works , one of the great achievements of humankind .
so that 's the good news .
unfortunately , this is good news , because there are some other problems , and it has been often .
and one of them is that , despite all of our achievements , a billion people in the world go to bed every day .
this number goes up , and they get very fast , and that 's embarrassing .
and not only that , we have our ability to use this world to survive .
drinking , <unk> land , rainforests , oil , gas : they disappear , and that soon , and if we 're not going to get us out of this chaos , we 're bound .
so the question is , can we do that ? i think .
i think it 's clear that we can produce food that will feed billions , without the country that they live .
i think we can do this world with energy that they 're not in the same time .
i do believe that , and no , that 's not wishful .
but here 's me at night awake -- one of the things that worries me at night . we 've never needed science as well as now .
and we were never able to get it in the position , and that 's how we can now .
we 're amazing at the cusp of amazing , amazing events on many areas , and yet , i really think that we have hundreds of , 300 years before we have to go back to the next time in which we have to have these things to be more sensitive than now .
people respond to their faiths , and that 's so closely so closely you ca n't free .
it 's not even the truth .
and listen , every right on his opinion , even a right on its opinion .
but you know what they 're right ?
they do n't have a right to your own facts . <unk> , they do n't .
and i needed a while to figure out this .
in a decade , i wrote an article about `` the new yorker , '' a little paper .
and i was amazed to the ground , based on the end of what the end of humanity is in the history of humanity .
i did n't know what i was supposed to do , so i just wrote a paper and went forward .
and then , i wrote a paper about <unk> technology .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were playing nuts .
so i wrote an article about this , and i could n't understand why people thought that molecule would be a random kind of a random sort of a random <unk> of nature in the area of nature .
but you know , i do what i 'm doing . i wrote the articles , and i kept on .
i mean , i 'm a journalist .
we do , we 're going to eat the food , that 's okay .
but the articles made me worried , and i could n't figure out why , and eventually , i found out .
and that 's because of these <unk> that did n't make me nuts at all .
these were <unk> people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like people in this room .
and this led me to be a bit suspicious ...
but then i thought , well , let me be honest .
we 're in a point where we do n't have the same relationship to progress as we did .
we 're talking about <unk> .
we 're talking about a little bit about a little bit about a little bit about it .
okay , for that reason , there is some reasons , and i think what will be .
we have faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in the science has lost , and there 's no reason why that should n't be .
you can just give some names and people understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people that we thought they would have to be right .
ask questions , ask the evidence you ask .
take nothing like this .
but now , interestingly , if you have to get the evidence , you 're not good .
and i can tell you that we now live in an epidemic of how i 've never seen , and i 'll hope again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a horrible story that <unk> <unk> with the shell , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
very scary .
and the studies was to see if it was true .
other studies should be done ; this is a serious business .
data came in .
the data came in from the u.s. , from england , from sweden , from the u.s. , from the u.s. , from the u.s. , from the u.s. , from the u.s. , from the u.s. , and they were all alike , no correlation , no association .
it does n't make any difference . it does n't make any difference , because we believe we believe what we see what we think is that we feel real .
we do n't think of a bunch of documents from a <unk> that 's us , and i understand that , i think , i think that 's what we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of that was devastating .
so , in fact , the united states is one of the only countries in the world , in which the price of food goes down .
that 's a <unk> and we should be ashamed .
it 's bad .
what happens is that we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
is someone getting it ?
has a single one in the audience ever have to look at someone 's disease ?
it 's not quite often .
in this country , it 's not in the world , most of the time in the world last year .
that 's a lot of deaths by less deaths , 20 per hour .
but because this is not what 's happened here , we can launch it , and people like an <unk> and <unk> of platforms like guitar and <unk> <unk> live .
and you can do that because they 're cause to be able to connect .
they do n't understand that these things seem to be a matter but never the same thing .
and that 's something we need to learn , and that 's very quick .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us from one of the worst of humanity .
no fear , no one , <unk> , <unk> .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he 's called paul <unk> .
he just developed with a couple of other people .
it can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 kids a year in the developing world .
pretty good , right ?
well , that 's good , apart that paul <unk> and talking about vaccines , and he says how valuable they are , and that people would just stop laughing .
and that 's what he does .
now , paul is a <unk> .
if paul was really speaking in a public <unk> , he ca n't talk to any other .
he gets calls home , because people like to tell you that you know where his children go to school .
and why ? five has done a <unk> .
i do n't need that , but that 's the way that are essential .
you take them to go back to the disease , horrible diseases , and that 's happening .
we are now getting on this country now .
and that 's going to be worse , and it 's going to get kids back to it , because that 's just a question .
and they 're not only going to die to you die .
what about wet adhesion ? do we use that . why ?
and i think a couple of weeks ago and i said , i think , i think , i 'm a little too binding .
nobody ever said before .
she would not vaccinate your kid . absolutely not .
it 's both .
why ? because we do n't have <unk> . and you know what ?
we had yesterday , in this country yesterday .
today , i do n't know , maybe i was in lagos , somebody in lagos , in the moment , he 's about ohio .
and in a few hours , he lands a car , and it comes back to long beach , and he 's going to visit one of these <unk> <unk> today today .
and he does n't know that it 's a <unk> disease , and we do n't know that , because this is the world .
that 's the planet that we live on . do n't it as if it 's not .
we love to paint ourselves . we love that .
do you all have taken your vitamins back to them ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , a little four-bar you can help them .
i know they did that because half of americans do it every day .
they take the stuff , and you take alternative powers , and it does n't make any difference how often we find out that they are useless .
the data looked at all the time .
they do n't raise their organs . more .
that 's okay , you 'd like to pay 28 billion dollars for dark .
i agree completely .
it 's dark . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do it ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the leader .
we hate a big government . we do n't trust in the system .
and we should n't do that . our health system is closed .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and <unk> self that can afford it .
so we 're going to run away , and where do we go ?
we run in the poor of the <unk> .
that 's great . i love oddities .
but you know , this is really a serious issue , because the stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars .
and i have all kinds of little fans here .
none of it -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , because i do n't even know what that is , but we spend billions of dollars for it .
and you know what ? if i say that , tell me the people , and say , `` what do you think ? let people do what they want .
you feel good . ''
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
because it does n't matter whether it 's the minister that says , `` hmm , i 'm not going to have to embrace the wisdom , '' or some <unk> who wants to treat his patients with <unk> .
if they 're moving on this way , where believe and magic are replacing science and science , they get into a place that you want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he took 400,000 times the people around , because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , much more effective than any drugs we know we know that they can get the recovery of aids .
hundreds of thousands of death deaths in a country , which is worse than any other of that disease .
do n't tell me that these things have no such consequences .
they have . they 're always .
well , the <unk> epidemic that we 're right now is this ridiculous battle between the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> .
that 's a <unk> debate . it has to stop .
it 's a debate about words about words .
that 's basically , not science .
everything we eat , every <unk> , every branch , every branch , every hood , has been changed by the people .
you know , there was no clan schools .
there was no escape hatch .
there was no bills . we did all of this .
we did it in the last four years .
and some of it has worked and some of them .
we 're hardwired to do it .
now , we can make it more , and of course , there 's risks . but we can do something like vitamin a child in rice , and the stuff can help millions , millions of people to prolong their lives .
you do n't want to do that ?
i have to say , i do n't understand .
we make <unk> <unk> .
why do we do it ?
now , what i 'm willing to do is : to many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , we do n't want big , which is wrong .
we do n't want companies to join companies .
we do n't want companies to have the seeds .
and you know what my answer is ?
yes , they 're right . let 's fix it .
it 's true , we have an enormous <unk> , but that 's not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it 's kind of morality , <unk> .
you know that the science is not a company .
it 's not a country .
it 's not one idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it works , but the idea that we should do n't allow the science to do , to do the work , because we have the idea of the science , and it 's holding millions of people by human beings .
you know , in the next 50 years , we 're going to have to grow 70 percent less food than the moment . 70 percent .
these investment in africa over the last 30 years .
embarrassing . <unk> .
they need that , and we do n't .
and why ? <unk> , <unk> food .
we do n't want to encourage people to do this <unk> stuff , like <unk> .
<unk> is something that 's half a billion people .
it 's something like a glue .
it 's just a bunch of calories . it 's closed .
it did n't have any nutrients , it has no protein , and scientists are building all this happening at it .
and then people could eat the food and they would n't be blind .
you would not commit , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it would n't be <unk> , but it would be nice .
and all i can say , why do we fight this ?
i mean , why are we fighting this ?
because we want to want to ask the genes ?
it 's not about genes . it 's not about chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , and it 's on greater food , better food , smarter food .
it 's not about <unk> , it 's about people living alive , and it 's going to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we do n't do that , if we 're going to continue to do that , we 're going to be guilty about something that we do n't want to be guilty , <unk> colonialism .
there is no other description for what 's going on .
it 's selfish , it 's ugly , it 's not worthy , and we have to stop it .
now , after this incredibly weird , excellent entertainment might you like , `` do you want to put you in these balloons and go into the future ? ''
anyway . that 's what i want to do .
right now , they 're in the present , but we have an incredible possibility .
we can ask these guys to everything we want .
we can <unk> them , where we want to <unk> them , and we 're going to move them to where we want .
we have to make these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to the time and we 're going to be happy to have that .
i know we can , and as far as i 'm concerned , is something that 's needs the world .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i 'm looking at the <unk> . it might seem strange to be a part of a magician , it 's because they look like `` a delusion that 's going to be a true thing , if someone just found enough of it . ''
in other words , you 've got a stunning effect on the <unk> , and it 's because the person thinks that it 's going to think about it , is a <unk> effect in the body you call the <unk> .
one of a deception is going to be something real , because someone believes it .
so let 's also understand each other , i want to show you a very simple definition .
and i 'm going to show you how it works . this is a trick that has been at least the 1950s in every country for children .
and i 've learned about the <unk> <unk> magic hero in the 1970s .
i 'm going to do it for you and then .
and then i 'm going to explain why i 'll explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife you can study , my hand , that you can study .
i will just hold the knife in my own .
i 'm off my sleeve back .
and to make sure , nothing in my sleeve hand , or out of him , i just blow my wrist here .
in this way , you can see that it 's time to move anything , and as long as i 'm here , nothing in my sleeve .
and the goal is very simple .
i 'm going to open my hand , and hopefully if everything is good , that knife came through my bare physical <unk> .
it 's actually in the place that i can shake it without the knife .
nothing goes on my sleeve or step out , not <unk> , and they can look at all .
<unk> !
now , this is a trick i often learn to be a little bit of little kids who care for love is because you can learn very much about deception , when you look at it , even though it 's a very simple thing to be accurate .
probably , many of you here in the room this trick .
so he does this .
i think knife in my hand .
i say , i put my wrist off to make sure that nothing in my sleeve hand , and that 's a lie .
the reason why i wrist my wrist forward is that there 's a mystery of illusion .
in the moment , where i took my hand away from you to see them from the back of the back , this guy walks here , my <unk> , just in the position he 's so <unk> .
great trick ?
there 's someone who had n't had a child .
so , here 's up here . exactly .
and when i <unk> my position , the fingers changes its position .
and now you might talk about why this is a delusion , why you do n't want to see that there 's just three fingers , because the mind and the way he did n't have information , one , two , three .
but this is not happening here . and then i get my hand .
of course , there 's been there , but not by the <unk> of my body , but through a trick , through my <unk> , who is now .
and when i close my hand , the same thing that i 'm going to do is , you know , when you turn me through this motion , you 'll see that your fingers will <unk> .
i 'll take that hand away . and here it is .
this trick can be your friends and neighbor . thank you .
now , what did this have to do with the problem ?
a year ago , i read a study that really blew me .
i 'm not a doctor or researchers , and that 's why it was an amazing thing .
it 's what 's true : if you put a <unk> in the form of the white pill , in the form of a <unk> , is that it just is a round of the body that 's just a certain effect .
but if you take the shape in which you 're going to put this money , for example , in a smaller pill , and that blue and a letter is actually measurable efficient .
and that , even though any of those -- it 's just <unk> .
but a white car is not as good as a blue ball .
what ? that made me really freak out .
but it turns out that it 's not all anything .
if you 're using it , they 're still more effective than any shape .
a colored drop on one end , and on the other hand , is better than a white cell .
again , the <unk> play is a role .
a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- i ca n't remember the exact opposite pills , i 'm sorry .
but the truth is ,
... that also play a role .
and the shape is a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to reach your needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a <unk> with a <unk> substance that you have to hang on a patient .
that creates a very strong image in your head , and that 's very much greater than a white ball .
this chart is really -- i 'm going to show you a different time , if we have a <unk> .
so , the fact is that the white pill pill is n't as good as the blue pill , which is n't as good as a box that does n't really feel like the needle .
and none of it has really <unk> property , and it 's just our faith that makes a stronger impact .
i wanted to know if i could be able to use this idea into a magic model .
i 'll take something that 's obviously a deception , and let it look like it .
we know from the study that you have to reach your needle , if it 's supposed to go to this .
this is a 18 inches long , and it 's very , very , very <unk> . and i 'm gon na make you a little bit .
this is really my 50th meat . it 's not <unk> <unk> .
this is my skin . this is not a <unk> tool .
so i 'm going to stick this needle into my skin and through them , pull up to the other side .
if you fall evil , if you fall easy to fall out -- i have a couple of friends last night in the hotel hotel , and some people i did n't know , and that 's a woman nearby .
so i 'm suggesting if you 're relieved fast , you 'll look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know , what i 'm going to do is to do the first thing in the back .
you can see it in a moment , but you can be relieved if you want .
so , it 's like this , right here , where my meat starts in the <unk> part , i 'm just going to make a little <unk> .
i 'm sorry . do you make it crazy ?
and just a little bit through my skin and on the other side .
now we 're actually in the same situation that we had in front of us .
roughly .
but now you can not count my finger , right ?
so i 'm going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when you see that .
they say , `` okay , that 's certainly not as silly and <unk> yourself the skin , just to give us a few minutes . ''
well , let me show you .
so what do you look like ? pretty good .
yes , i know .
and the people behind the back , `` okay . i 've not seen that . ''
the people in the front ages are now in the 1970s .
let me show you with you .
this is really my skin . this is not a <unk> tool .
that 's my meat , and i can tell the <unk> .
sorry . if you 're relieved , look away , look at it .
the people in the back of the back , or the ones that later later later on top video , say , `` well , this is really notable , but if it was real , he would -- you see , this is a hole and there , if it was really real , it would spit . ''
okay , let me make a little bit of blood for you .
yes , there 's it .
now , normally i would use the needle .
i would clean my arm , and you show that there are no <unk> .
but i think , in this context here , and with intention , i 'm just going to let the needle , i 'm just going to let the needle and whatnot from the stage .
we 're going to face a few times in the next days .
i hope they 're looking for me . thank you very much .
everybody 's talking today about happiness .
so i have the number of books , the number of books , which are published with `` <unk> '' in the last five years , and they would have a lot more .
there 's an enormous wave of the interest of researchers in researchers .
there 's a lot of <unk> .
everybody would love to make people happier .
but despite all of these <unk> , there are several cognitive plants that are really impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is now mainly from these cognitive traps .
now , this is true for h.r that makes you think about your own happiness , and it 's true for scientists who think we 're just so superior to everybody else .
the first one of those traps is an indicator of complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is not a one-time word , because we apply it to many different things .
i think there 's a certain meaning that we might be going to be able to harness , but in the big , and all of the complicated way we have to embrace , and we 're going to embrace the complicated way to think about what 's comfort .
the second thing is a nuance of experience and memory : basically , it 's between being in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they 're both tan in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that 's the number of fact that we do n't think about a situation that does physical decision-making without its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive event .
there 's just no way to get it right .
now , i would like to begin with an example of someone who had a <unk> , after my lectures , who was a story , and it was perfectly beautiful music , and at the end of the mind , there was a <unk> sound .
and then he put it , really emotional , that has felt the whole experience .
but it did n't .
and what it was intended to have had the memory of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of <unk> music .
she did n't <unk> , because he was a memory , and the memory was ruined , and memory was all he had to keep .
what this really says is that we could think about ourselves and about other people , in terms of two ways of self .
there 's a <unk> self that lives in the present world , and the present people can know , can experience the past again , but basically it 's essentially the present .
it 's the <unk> itself , which is the doctor 's physician -- you know when the doctor asks , `` does it hurt , if i 'm wearing it ? ''
and then there 's a <unk> self , and the <unk> itself is that the <unk> and the story of our lives and it 's the question , `` how did you have felt in lately ? ''
or `` how did you get to albania ? ''
these are two very different entities , the hunter-gatherer self itself and the <unk> self , and the two people are being part of the <unk> of the happiness .
well , the <unk> itself itself is a storyteller .
and that begins with a fundamental reaction on your memory -- it starts out immediately .
we do n't just tell stories if we 're doing ourselves to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we 're allowed to do with our social experiences is a story .
and let 's start with an example .
there 's a old study .
these are real patients banding in a painful script .
i 'm not going to go into the details . it 's not painful , but it was painful than this trial in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all the 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they 're asked , `` who else have more ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
patient b is clear . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain that 's a patient b , and more .
but there 's another question , `` how much did these patients think they were ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient is a much riskier <unk> of the <unk> than the patient .
the stories of the <unk> are different , and because a very important part of history is what it ends up .
and none of the stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is worse worse than the other .
and the worse thing that was worse , where the pain was at the end on its peak . it 's a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we 've asked these people to the <unk> , and we too much later , `` well , how bad was the whole thing ? ''
and she was much worse for a than for b in the <unk> .
well , this is a direct problem between the <unk> itself and the <unk> .
from the <unk> self , b is really a <unk> period .
now , what you might do with your patient , and we 've actually done clinical experiments , and it 's done , and it 's working , you might actually be able to get the <unk> of the tube inside the tube without him .
that will happen to the patient , but just a little bit and much less than that .
and if you take a few minutes , you 're going to say that the <unk> self itself is a little bit better from the patient , it 's a little bit better , because now you have a better story about his experience .
what did a story is from ?
and that 's true for the stories that tell your memory , and it 's also true for the stories that we make .
but what you 're looking at is the story of a story , particularly moments and end .
they 're very , very , very important , and in this case , <unk> the end .
now , the <unk> self itself lives its lives .
it 's moments of <unk> , one of the other .
and they ask , what 's happening with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're lost forever .
i mean , most of our moments of our lives -- and i have this -- you know , the psychological presence for one 10 seconds , which means that it 's about 600 million of them . in a month , there is about 600,000 .
most of you are completely ignored by the <unk> self .
and yet , you kind of get the sense that they should count that what 's happening in this moments of compassion .
it 's the limited resource we use , as we are in the world .
and as we do n't use it , it 's important , but that 's not the story that 's keeping for us .
so we have the reckless self and the <unk> self , and they 're really quite different .
the vast difference between you is the deal with time .
out of view of the car self , if you have a holiday , and the second one week is exactly like the first thing , the <unk> holiday is twice as good as the <unk> vacation .
that 's not how it works at all the time .
so for the sake of self , there 's a <unk> holiday barely better than the <unk> holidays because there 's no new memory .
they do n't have changed the story .
and on this case , time , critical variable , which is different from a <unk> self , and that has very little influence on this story .
now , the <unk> itself is doing more than remembering and stories .
it 's actually quite the decisions that decisions , because if you have a patient , say , two bites to two different surgeons and decides that he 's supposed to vote , and that 's the surgeon who will recognize .
the <unk> self itself has no voice in this choice .
in fact , we do n't choose between us . we choose between memory on experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we do n't think about our future as a experiences .
we think about our future as a <unk> memory .
and basically , you can think about this , you know , as a dreamer of the <unk> self , and you can think about yourself as one , which is the <unk> self , and you can actually think of yourself as one , which is not a thing that does n't need the <unk> self .
and i have the sense that if we 're going to have to holiday , this is what we 're going to do is , you know , <unk> in the services of the <unk> self .
and that 's a little bit hard to have , i think .
i mean , how much does we memories ?
that 's one of the things that will be given for the dominance of the planet itself .
and when i think about it , i think of a holiday that we 've done a few years ago , which was clearly the best one i ever had , and i think , quite often because of how often i think about others .
and i think of my memory on this epic journey , i would say about 25 minutes for last four years .
well , if i had the tv system with the 600 pictures in this room , i would have spent another shot .
well , these are three weeks , and they 're number of hours .
and there seems to be a consequence .
well , i like a little extreme , you know , in this , how much deep , i have a real question . why are we going to reactivate a lot of weight on the screen of the weight that we 're flourishing ?
so i want you to think about a thought .
imagine your next holiday , you know , that at the end of the day , you know your images , and they get a <unk> drug , so you 're going to remember that .
well , would you choose the same holidays ?
and if you 'd pick a different officer , there 's a conflict between your two senses of self , and you have to think about how to the conflict , and it 's not obvious , because if you think about the senses of time , you 'll get one answer . and if you think of memories , they 'll get a different answer .
so why we have the reckless scripts that we choose is a problem that presents us with a choice between the two types of self .
now , the two types of self are calling two terms of happiness .
there 's actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one of a self .
so you can ask , how much is that <unk> self ?
and then they would ask , how happy are the moments of the <unk> themselves ?
and they 're all -- very complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and by the way , we 're capable of a pretty good idea from happiness 's happiness .
if you 're looking at happiness 's happiness , it 's a very different thing .
that 's not about how happy people live .
it 's about being satisfied or delighted , if this person thinks about your life .
very different realized .
anybody who 's not going to screw these terms of happiness , and i 'm a lot of researchers about well-being that have been <unk> exploration in the right way .
the distinction between happiness is the luck of itself , and the satisfaction of the <unk> self , it 's been discovered in the last few years , and now you 're trying to measure the two together .
the inflationary organization has had a global survey , where more than a half million people ask them to think about what they think about their lives and about their experiences . and there was other efforts in the direction .
so in the last couple of years , we started to learn about happiness in the last couple of self .
and the environmental thing we believe , i think , is that they are really different .
you can know how much he 's with his life , and you do n't know how much he lives his life and vice versa .
just to give you an idea of the sun that 's about <unk> .
what that means is that if you hit somebody , and you 'd say , oh , his dad is a <unk> , how much would you know ?
well , you would know something about your size , but there 's a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone 's going to be a eight on a scale of 10 <unk> , they have a lot of uncertainty about it , like he 's on his <unk> .
so it 's very low .
we know something about what 's happiness .
we know that money is very important , it 's something important .
we know happiness to be happy with people that we like to spend time with people we like .
there 's other delight , but that 's what it is .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of self , they 're going to do very different things .
and the result of what i said here is that we should not have to think about a weapon of well-being .
it 's a completely different word .
now , very quickly , another reason that we do n't really think about happiness is that we 're not going to be interested in the same things that we think about life and when we live .
so if you ask the simple question , like happy people in california are not the right answer .
if you think they 're thinking that people have to be happier in california , say , in ohio life .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think of the difference between california and other places , and that difference , we say climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the ministry of self , and it 's not even very important for the <unk> self , which decides how happy people are .
now , because the point itself is responsible in itself , you can draw some people in california .
and it 's sort of interesting to track , what happens to people , the people who draw to california , happier .
now , your <unk> self is not happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . they think they 're happier , because if you think about it , you 'll remember how awful the weather was in ohio , and they feel like they 've met the right decision .
it 's very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i have a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you very much .
now , when we looked at a few weeks ago , they came up with me that there was a pretty interesting outcome , which came out of this session .
is this something that you can play with , because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure . sure .
i think the most exciting thing that we have found in the cybersecurity survey , which is a number that we 're not expected to find .
we found that in terms of happiness itself .
when we looked at how emotions to the income .
and it turns out that , under a $ $ 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and that 's a very large sample of americans , about <unk> , but it 's a major demographic sample , under a $ income of the $ six dollars .
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they get increasingly less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less than ever .
we 'll get a perfectly flat line .
i mean , i 've just seen that flat lines .
what 's happening is that money does n't have a monopoly , but that is that the lack of money gets a <unk> stranger , and we can measure this misery very , very clearly .
in the spirit of the other self , the <unk> self , you get another story .
the more money you deserve is you deserve .
that 's not for emotion .
but danny , in the whole american sense , it 's about living , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
now , if people would take that magic seriously , i mean , it seems to be everything on the head , everything that we think of , for example , in terms of <unk> and so forth .
is there a chance that politicians would have to take the country that the country would have to take a sense of how to look at politics ?
dk : you know , i believe that there 's some reason for the role of <unk> in politics .
the truth is going to be slowly in the united states , not a question , but in the united kingdom , they 're just in other countries .
people are in the case they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
it 's going to be a while , and people are going to have to study whether they want to explore whether they want to explore that discussion pretty soon .
as a result , it can be a very different amount of how you think and how you think about yourself , or if they 're thinking about the <unk> themselves .
that 's going to affect politics , i think , in the next year .
in the united states , you 're in the united states you 're going to measure the population of the population .
that 's going to be part of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me , this theme , or should least be the most political debate over the next couple of years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i 'm an old duck . i 'm gon na play video games .
now , i 've been running away now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to save the world in reality how to save it in <unk> .
i have a plan for that . i want to convince more people , including all of them , more time playing with play and play games .
currently now spend three billion hours a week .
some of you might think , `` this is a whole lot of time for games . ''
maybe a little too much time , when you think about how many problems we have to solve the real world .
in fact , in fact , my research on the institute for the future , is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week is not close to the world of the world of the world .
in fact , i 'm convinced that if we want to survive the next century , we have to increase this time .
i mean , it 's time for a 21 billion hours a week .
this might seem to be a little bit of <unk> , so let me tell you that it can be : if we 're acting like hunger , poverty , global warming , global strife , obesity , i have to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week .
no , i 'm really serious .
why ? this image is quite exactly why i believe that games are so essential to survival of the human species in the future .
this is a tudor portrait of photographer <unk> .
and he wanted to make the feelings of play . so he did a camera a camera .
so this is one of the classic expressions .
if you do n't have a player , you might recognize some of the modifications in this picture .
you 're probably seeing this sense of urgency , some fear , but also a very complicated problem in solving a real problem .
if you 're playing , you can see some of them here , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrow just surprise .
this is a player that 's on the outskirts of a call called <unk> .
oh , you know that . ok. well , well . so we 've got some players here .
a <unk> victory is a result that was so very positive , that they did n't know that it was possible .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and when they 're reaching it , they 're shocked that they 're actually going to be able to get anything like that . this is a premature victory .
this player is a short <unk> victory .
and this is what we have to look at millions of lives in the world , if we take the boomers of the next century in utero , the face of those who rely on the brink of a <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we see more of this face in real life when we face a tough deal .
i 'm going to compare it to life , and it 's my face , you know ? yes ?
so that 's what i 'm doing `` in life , i 'm bad . ''
this is a graffiti in my home home home in berkeley , california , where i was doing better in play better than in real life .
that 's a problem that many players have .
we think that we are not so good as in play .
and i do n't just succeed , even though that 's coming .
we 're going to do more . i mean , well , in the context , with the motivation , to do something wrong to collaborate with each other .
if we 're in a <unk> , i think , a lot of us in our best , anytime and immediately are <unk> , <unk> the problem with solving so long , it 's going to try to do so long after the <unk> again .
and in reality , if we do failure when we rely on obstacles , we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed , we feel ourselves , we feel threatened , perhaps depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
we never have these feelings if we play games , it just ca n't .
and that 's what i wanted to study as a leader .
why is it impossible to think , you could n't just do anything ?
so how can we spread these emotions to the reality ?
so i looked like world of warcraft on warcraft , which is the ideal environment to the collaborative problem .
and i have found some things that i 've found the epic world in <unk> so possible .
so first , if you put in one of those phrases , especially at the world of warcraft , there are a lot of different characters that are willing to give you a <unk> mission .
but not only any mission , it 's a mission that 's perfect to your current state , right ?
so they 're going to do that .
they never get a task that you ca n't resolve .
but always on the edge of your capabilities , so they have to be hard . but there 's no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you do n't sit around and you 're <unk> , and there 's always going to have some important thing .
and there 's certain employees .
everywhere , hundreds of thousands of people that work with them , hundreds of the epic mission .
we do n't have the real life so simple in real life so simple , that feeling that you 're willing to have a sense of attention to some of employees .
there 's this epic story , this inspiring history , why we are there and what we have .
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
they 're driven by `` the level of the sun , '' and `` smart strength , '' `` golden intelligence . ''
that electronic feedback is not in real life .
if i leave that stage , i do n't leave us , cash talk , and making it weird , <unk> crazy idea .
i do n't get a real life of feedback .
so the problem with the world of warcraft is that it 's so instinctive anytime at the edge of a <unk> <unk> , that we 're going to spend all of our time in the same time .
they 're just better than the reality .
up until today , all the world of <unk> together have been <unk> together , <unk> million years trying to solve virtual problems .
that 's not necessarily bad .
it sounds bad .
but to look at it in context , <unk> million years ago , our first <unk> process began to go .
so the first of that , you know ,
ok , so if we 're talking about how much time we spend in terms of time we spend the time in terms of the human development .
but it turns out , because it turns out that we 're using this whole time to play out of play , actually the difference that we 're capable of .
we 're developing to our local , thank you .
that 's the truth . that 's what i believe .
let 's look at this interesting statistic recently recently , who was published by a census of the carnegie mellon university , the average young man , today , in a country , approximately 10,000 hours , <unk> , 10,000 hours , 10,000 hours with <unk> to the 21st .
so for 10,000 hours , a pretty interesting number , for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , <unk> hours are <unk> hours of the exact <unk> they spend in school , from 5 .
so , we have a complete <unk> , where young people learn what it means to be a good player , like everything else to learn in school .
and perhaps some of you have signed the new book of post-traumatic robots , `` <unk> . ''
so you know his theory , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it 's based on the great exploration of the <unk> , that if we spend 10,000 hours to the 21st performance , to the 21st century , in a way , we 're spending gaining it .
we 're going to be so good at whatever , whatever the world 's greatest people .
so what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , `` what are you doing good ? ''
because if we could n't find that out there , we would never have the opportunity to do that .
so many people , we 're in the world that one hour a day with <unk> .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people that are exceptionally good in `` something . ''
and over the next decade , we have another billion players that are extraordinarily good in whatever .
if you do n't hear it .
the <unk> developed <unk> , the energy save and on <unk> , rather than the <unk> , so the players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil online .
you expect a extra billion players on the next decade .
that 's what we 've been on is 1.5 billion players .
so i started to think about what it is , what do you think of these games .
so here 's the 4 things i found . so first , <unk> .
okay , think about the extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do something to do it , which is that we have a <unk> faith in success .
players think that 's a <unk> victory is possible , and that it 's always worth it 's going to try and happen in the same way .
players do n't sit around .
players are masters of social nets .
there 's a lot of interesting research that we can tell people more like , after we 've defeated them , even if they defeated .
the reason is that there 's a lot of trust with someone to play a game .
we trust that someone 's time with us claim that the rules of the rules are going to be <unk> , that we have the same thing and to stay in the course .
so that allows you to grow on the body , trust and together .
as a result , we 're going to build a lot of social relationships .
<unk> . fantastic !
you know , there 's one reason why the hell of <unk> <unk> 22 hours a week .
the reason is that when we play games , we 're actually happier at work , than if we 're going to do or nothing .
we know that we work as human beings when we do hard , big jobs .
and gamers are always prepared to work hard when they get the right task .
and finally , i swear .
players love to be part of being <unk> <unk> .
here 's a <unk> , showing you back to the right-hand light , you know , determines the wikipedia , the world 's greatest carnivorous .
the second <unk> of the world , with nearly more greenhouse gasses is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about the world of warcraft on the internet , and the other matter in every other was the world .
they create an art story .
they 're creating an accurate source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
all right , so these are four superpowers leads to a single outcome . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
these are people who believe that they can change as individuals .
and the only problem is that they believe they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
that 's the problem i 'm trying to solve .
edward livingstone is a <unk> .
his work is genius , and he studies why people spend so much time to spend energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , `` we 're gon na not less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . ''
and this is a <unk> . so he 's logical .
and he says ...
do n't like me -- i mean , i swear , i 'm a little sharper .
so he says that makes sense , because players can reach into more than a real life .
they can play stronger social bonds than in the real life , and they get more and <unk> in play as in the real life .
so , he says , it 's currently totally logical estimate that players are more time in the virtual world as in the real world .
i just agree , that 's logical .
but it 's definitely not <unk> .
we need to begin to transform the real world in a game .
my inspiration comes from an event , which is 100 years of research .
there 's this <unk> , <unk> . you know ?
there was a fantastic <unk> that was <unk> .
and these are the first of people developed <unk> .
and if you 're familiar with the <unk> of old greek <unk> , you may know that story , and the story about how the story has been invented .
according to <unk> , games , in the kingdom , in the kingdom of famine .
well , think about this great famine , the king of <unk> was led to a crazy idea .
people have people . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation . you needed a extreme solution .
so they invented loud , the <unk> , the <unk> , and <unk> a national strategy . the next day you would play .
and they would be so much in the <unk> and they 're going to be the same thing , and you 're playing with <unk> , <unk> groups , that they would have to be eating there .
and then the next day you would play , and the next day they would eat .
and according to the next few years they were able to get this famine to turn on a day and the next one .
in the same way , i think we 're playing games .
we are playing games to escape the suffering of the real world .
we 're playing games in order to avoid everything that does n't work in the real world , the real life is not subjective , and we 're going to do whatever we need .
but it does n't have to be the end .
that 's the exciting thing .
according to 18 years old , i was n't getting better , so the king decided to make a last month .
they shared the kingdom in two .
she was a <unk> , and the winner was sent to a <unk> accident .
she left <unk> , and they got themselves up looking for a new home , and they were walking so many people back to survive , and they were looking at the rest of a site where they could thrive .
that sounds ridiculous , right ?
but recent <unk> shows that the <unk> that came out of the <unk> realm that have the same dna like the ancient <unk> .
and so scientists came up recently that <unk> ' crazy story was actually true .
and geologists found evidence of a global ethic that almost 20 years to explain the famine .
so this crazy story might be true .
you may have saved your people by games by having 18 years and then , and then they 've saved them for 18 years , and then they have to have been able to have saved the whole civilization .
so that 's what we can do .
we 're all in 1994 .
this was the first <unk> of <unk> in the world of <unk> . that was 16 years ago .
she was <unk> for 18 years , we 've been confused for 16 years .
i 'm assuming we 're willing to play on our own mental game .
so , you 've got half of its civilization on the lookout for a new world , so that 's what i 'm going to take 21 billion a week .
we should be estimated that half of us an hour a day with play until we have the problems of the real world .
and i know they 're asking , `` how do we solve problems of the real world in games ? '' and that 's exactly what i 'm doing my work in the center for the future .
we 've got this banner in our office in palo alto , we should have to understand the future .
we do n't want to try to say the future .
what we want to do is the future .
we want to think about the best outcome , and then people make that idea into reality .
we 're going to think about setting us and give people the possibilities of them .
i 'm going to show you three games that i designed to try to try to do people in their own future .
this is `` world without oil . ''
the game is from 2007 .
it 's a <unk> that you have to study a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we have plenty enough to do it for you , and they get plenty in real life without oil , so , if you 're going to get out of game , you 're going to get the real life without oil , which is , you know , they get enough to blog , to take videos or listen .
we tested this game with <unk> players in 2007 , and we 've entered them over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was an inherent experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it 's good for the environment or because we should .
but when they 're in a <unk> accident , and they say , `` we 're going to get this oil . ''
that 's a fascinating adventure to you .
find out how they would survive , most of our players have gone in the game of habits .
so we have to play ourselves for the next olympics game , a bigger , more objective than just <unk> .
we 've developed the game `` <unk> , the future to the future . ''
now , the calculation is that one of the things that people are only seven years on the planet .
this supercomputer , `` global <unk> , '' of course .
the call to the players , at the beginning , we 're almost <unk> designed .
you know , they know jerry <unk> , where it 's called `` <unk> , '' they have the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> , and you can save the world .
but in our game , rather than just five people , we say , everybody is in <unk> , and it 's our job , the future for energy , food , security , secure and the future of social justice .
so 8,000 players were playing the game eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read when they 're <unk> .
and the last game we take on the three century . it 's a game in conjunction with the world bank .
if you go to the game , you get from the world 's largest <unk> , at 2010 .
we 're working with universities in all sub-saharan africa and perceives them to learn social .
we have a comic problem . we have `` level '' for processing technology , <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want to all invite you to share this game with young people everywhere in the world , especially in <unk> , who managed to spend their own social sector to save the world .
i 'll come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think , what happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we have n't yet saved the real world .
well , i hope that you can agree with the fact that the players are human resource that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for transformation .
we have all sorts of superpowers , high-speed productivity , the ability to connect strong social networks , <unk> and the desire .
i really hope we 're playing together with great games to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you will design and play with me like that .
so , when i first said back to the next decade , i 'm sure that we can create a <unk> future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let me start with play <unk> .
thank you .
i would like to tell you something like this a few months ago , i 'd notice you know .
i always kind of writing , but i realized that i was never in my life , which the word `` disabled '' really means .
i 'll read you the post .
free is : `` <unk> , singer , environmental , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
<unk> : healthy , strong , <unk> . ''
i took this list to a friend of read , and i had to wait for , it was so ridiculous , but i was only to read , and i had to read , and i had to read , and i had to read , and i had to read and to stop , and i had to read and to stop , and i had to read and to stop clicking after this <unk> <unk> and she had emotional shock .
of course , this was a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and i just thought the cartoon must be quite old .
but in fact , it was a replica in the early 1980s , when i started with elementary school , and it started to build my life outside of my family environment , and also in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me .
and god would n't use a <unk> .
if i would have to take this post seriously , i would have one of the world who would perceive me as a person whose life was going to be a person whose lives in a molecular situation can be positive , but today i 'm going to be interested in the opportunity and adventure i 've been .
so i immediately asked the <unk> of 2009 , and i expected to find a <unk> .
here 's the <unk> version of this <unk> .
it 's not much better .
in particular , the last two words in the last two words under `` lean '' and `` healthy . ''
but it 's not just about words .
it 's about what we think about people who describe to these words .
it 's about the values that stuck in these words , and how we create these values .
and we think about our language and how we think of the world and the people around us .
a lot of <unk> societies , including the greeks , and the <unk> , have really believed that the <unk> of a <unk> was a big force , because that 's what you can also do .
so , what do we want to do -- a human people or a human human condition ?
in a way alone , people were signaling as a child , would be done , they could be <unk> and they mate .
would n't it be nice to open up ?
a man who opened up for me , was my birth <unk> . <unk> institute in <unk> .
he 's called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , as you can think , most americans could n't be accurate . so he was always called `` <unk> . ''
and dr. <unk> she used to fly very colorful , and it was just like materials .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just amazing -- to my <unk> .
and i had to use individual exercises with this heavy , <unk> <unk> -- in various colors -- that you know , and i hated them . i hated it .
and imagine , i even already as a <unk> child with dr. <unk> , and so on to stop these exercises , <unk> without success .
and one day , he came up with one of my exercises -- these exercises were just silly and sticks -- and he said to me , and he said to me , `` wow , <unk> , you 're so a strong , <unk> and young girls , you 'll tear one of these down .
and if you make it , i 'll give you a hundred dollars . ''
that was , of course , it was just a simple trick from dr. jefferson , so i wanted to make the exercises that i do n't want to do with the prospect that mayors <unk> girl in the hospital bed , but he actually did some new and <unk> experience .
and i wonder , today , how much of his vision is as strong , and <unk> young girl has shaped , and i could imagine , as a result from strong , powerful and <unk> .
that 's just one example of how adults can be able to be a child 's imagination .
but as we 've already made examples of the <unk> debate , we do n't have a little bit of space , something that we would all want to do : to enable it to enable itself as a human person .
and the language of language is the social changes behind the social changes , and what happened in a lot of technology change .
from the medical point from looking at , of course , my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> from titan and artificial <unk> for the world that people allow , really , all their own possibilities , and at the borders , they allow them to be able to use their natural destiny , but not talk to the social sector platforms , people will make their own identity , and they provide a lot of the world that they can do .
so , maybe this technology change is true because of this technology , that every human ability to go to the society , you can have a lot of truth and very poor , and that the human ability to be struggling , our biggest one is plus us .
human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell you how i 'm standing on with infinite , and i 'm always going to get out of you , and i understand why .
now this sentence from interactions with environmental lives is that success or happiness depends on a challenge without being challenged to the experience , as if my life is so successful , because i could perceive the possible fall of a life with a <unk> , or whatever people could perceive me with my disability .
but the truth is that we 're changing , of course , we are in the challenge , whether they 're physically , emotionally or even both .
and i 'm assuming that is good .
there are no impediment worth that we have to anticipate , to get to our lives .
<unk> are just to our lives .
and i 've been leaning to see some of my shadow .
sometimes i realized that he 's very appealing , sometimes it 's not to see , but he 's constantly on me .
and i want to do not want to do the impact , the heavy of the <unk> of a man .
so , there are interaction in life , and the challenges , and they 're just luxurious in real , and every person walks to it . but the question is , whether we 're not going to do it or not , but we 're clear .
so we 're not just responsible , the people that we love to preserve , but they 're also prepared to get good .
and we do n't think of our children if we give them feel that they ca n't be able to adapt .
you have to separate two things : to be a medical fact , an medical fact , and for the other , the social impact about whether i 'm an disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real real matter , and some disability , which i had to put together with , is that the world is all , and i could describe me to this one .
in our desire to protect us to the heart , and you have the cool , hard truth about their medical sector , or even a potentially give to quality of life that they thought we do n't want to put us out of the ground for somebody else is .
maybe this is what we think about is that this is the concept that only is what 's broken in the 1970s , and as we repair it , for each one more than a bigger disability than it is .
if we do n't have to treat a human being , and not all of his forces and possibilities and we recognize the natural struggle that you might have to have .
we <unk> a people who has value for our society .
so we have to look at the root data and all of all of human possibilities .
but most importantly , it 's between perception of our transactions and our great joy , a connection .
we should do n't have a look at the time or <unk> , we should n't try to avoid it , to avoid them under the carpet , but it 's about giving the probability opportunities .
so , maybe i 'm very much more likely to overcome clear that we do n't necessarily have to overcome adversities , but that we 're open , and they 're not necessarily using a <unk> , and maybe you could dance .
and maybe we make it compulsory as a little natural , <unk> and useful to see and feel a little natural , and feel a useful presence in the presence of its presence .
in this year , we 're talking about the 200 grade in this year , and the 200 of charles darwin and when he wrote about 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , on something very true in the human character .
and i would like this : not the most powerful thing to survive , and it 's not the <unk> of its way , but that changes changes .
there 's conflicts of conflicts of conflict .
not just from the original work , we know that the ability of the people , to survive and <unk> , from the battle of the human mind , is moving through conflicts .
so , again , change and <unk> are the <unk> skills .
and maybe we do n't know what the timber we are digging when we 're really hired .
in fact , that 's the sense of rehabilitation , is an sense of the self , a sense of our own power .
we can be so ashamed of ourselves .
we can give confirmation a new meaning that goes beyond very heavy times .
maybe we can see clusters as a change .
<unk> are for a change that we have n't adapted .
i think of the greatest harm that we have to have , is that we should be normal .
well , who 's normal ?
there 's no normal thing .
there 's the usual thing . the typical one , but not the normal one , and you would have to really know how to learn that , you know ?
i think it 's not .
it would be great if we have this paradigm of the normal versus another of the possibility or the strength , to be able to be able to be able to be able to talk to the very many kids , and you can invite them to be a special and valuable skills to society .
<unk> have been found that we have to have people who have the world 's disease : to be useful and a contribution .
there 's some evidence that this occur in 60,000 years older people and people have had heavy physical injuries with heavy physical injuries , and that may happen , because the life process of that human beings are valuable .
they do n't have seen these people as a broken and useless , they were <unk> as something special and valuable .
a couple of years ago , i was living in the city where i grew up in the red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i said there was a <unk> sweater .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear what a guy told me , `` well , you know , that 's not <unk> . ''
and i 'm looking at it and see that dead man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , `` well , sir , sir , do n't we ?
and he said , `` well , you do n't really remember me .
when i first saw it , i got her out of your mother . ''
oh , so here .
and of course , it 's done .
this was dr. <unk> , a man who i only had from tales of my mother 's tales , because i knew very typical , at my birthday two weeks .
the doctor in my mother was a holiday , and my parents had the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet came to them , and i just had a couple of toes on this and a couple of sentences on this , and a couple of <unk> on the other hand , he was the <unk> , that strangers had to be the bad news .
he said , `` i had to tell her parents that you would never walk , and never like other kids , or that you can never live a stranger , and then they 're just lying in me . ''
and really extraordinary , i found that he had channeled my entire childhood , no matter whether i had my scholarship in the second grade , whether i had to actually won the <unk> in the second grade , if i had my scholarship or one of my favorite writers , and he used these clips to teach his students from <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> the x factor to human beings .
it 's just not enough , like this particular thing to human quality of people .
and dr. <unk> goes on , he said , `` i learned that kids , if they did n't get anything else , and even when you get kids together , then you can reach a lot . ''
notice , dr. <unk> has changed his way .
he had understood that medical diagnosis and how somebody would handle them , two different things .
and i have changed my thinking in the time when she had to ask me in the age of 15 years , i would have taken my elbow against the legs and the bones , i would have no second .
i wanted to make a very normal position .
if you ask me today , i 'm not quite sure .
and that 's happened because i 've experienced it with my legs and not despite this experiences .
and maybe that changes could happen , because i have so many people who have opened me to open me , rather than people who would give me or give me an idea .
you see , it 's really just one of the people who show you how to interpret your powers , and they are .
if you can get someone to activate your own , inner forces , the human spirit is so <unk> -- if you can do it , and for somebody in a critical moment a door , you 're very good teachers .
they bring them to open up doors .
the real meaning of the word `` <unk> '' is `` <unk> . ''
it means to make something that is the potential for the potential .
again , what the potential do we want to do ?
in the '60s , in britain , there was a <unk> class in britain , and then <unk> in <unk> .
they call this `` <unk> afternoons '' in the united states , we call this as `` <unk> . ''
students are going to go to grades .
and then the students get <unk> harder , the better teachers and so forth .
they then surveyed a <unk> period , and they have `` potentially '' the note `` very good , '' they said they 're very smart , and after that three months , they really wrote a band-aid .
and of course , it <unk> the heart that the <unk> was told they 're just enough .
and in the same way , it 's been a three months .
but only those who were in school -- apart from the students who had paid the school .
the teachers was in the study that teachers were n't <unk> .
the teachers did n't know that something changed .
they were just told you that were the ones who are the students who were interested in , and they have treated them to be treated .
the only real disability is a thing that 's broken , has no hope . it does n't get any hope .
but if we do it , we continue to support the human spirit , to hope , and other people around us to be beautiful , curious and <unk> , and then we 're really positive .
when a spirit about these qualities is what we can do a new reality and new <unk> .
i want to end up with a poem that was a poet poet named <unk> in the 1400s , and the poem is `` the god who only four words , '' `` every child knows god , not the god of the name , but the god who only has four words and all the time that he always says , `` come , dance with me . ''
come on , dance with me . thank you very much .
