yes , good afternoon ladies , my gentlemen .
so , very much , thanks to talk about this to talk today .
and i have to imagine myself now .
my name is christian <unk> , and i 'm strange , <unk> at <unk> .
that 's what 's called <unk> 's <unk> .
and my favorite statistic is : first of the world 's exciting organization , third , third , third , public order .
so i 'm responsible for the ministry of this city .
and yeah , you do n't do it .
i know .
and beyond it , and that 's something which my son , particularly , i 'm also <unk> .
i mean , i 'm the head of <unk> fire .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and i think , of course , i think of a theme that i want to ask you today .
and the theme of the <unk> , because it 's also beginning to fire .
we hope to the best and we 're going to do the worst thing , which has said , what it is said .
you know it .
he was even interested in general <unk> .
and then i start to start doing something quite interesting .
i 'll make them a better job .
so , if there is a risk that we 're going to stand on a disaster , for example , <unk> <unk> , shopping .
lots of people are gone on the road .
it 's pushing , it 's <unk> .
and somewhere on the edge there is a suitcase , lonely , left , you might have a <unk> , maybe <unk> with signs .
no one seems to be .
the suitcase is no .
suddenly a little bit more .
let 's leave the <unk> .
police : <unk> , <unk> .
people are calling .
paid <unk> .
go out out .
what 's going on ?
we do n't know that or we ca n't say .
the people leave the building .
children cry .
some of them might even be in , because it 's got to go to it .
all of a piece of a piece of a piece .
there 's <unk> there .
panic .
i 'm hearing now .
the rest of the rest of the rest of your imagination .
but it 's not a fantasy that i have <unk> .
that 's exactly what happens in this week .
there 's a number of a suitcase .
and then , in fact , this was only , in <unk> , nine kilogram drugs .
but people were just so , and so a friend told me this , from the building .
it 's not said .
and it came out , and it was at least in the group of the group that my friend was in my friend .
and god is n't panic , otherwise it 's not rocket as true as it seems .
you can see , in a <unk> , a lot of this is a lot of good things to do it .
communication is therefore important because people in this situation is being used to interspecies communication .
you want to know what 's going on .
in the old days , in the old days , that was quite easy for the authorities .
we just have n't said or we lied .
why ?
because the so-called <unk> was the so-called slurry .
you have to say , `` god , people get into panic , '' there is n't the truth , or we do the <unk> .
this is in a period of social media , in a period of twitter , in a period of facebook , in a period of private and public <unk> , in a period of <unk> and public tv , in a time of <unk> and public tv .
simple and so , for example , because of the first , is not something morally , and second , but we 're as a question that 's what we call the last term that are supposed to report .
you may remember the world 's gravitational equipment in the hudson river , a few years ago .
the first one message about twitter .
from someone who was on a conservation , and it 's very palpable and immediately , there 's a plane and we save people to do .
that was n't a <unk> .
you can see , we 're on this today , and now , of course , the truth and say the truth to be very <unk> .
because mostly of course , we 're also the last last thing that we know , because we have to look at it , we 're only paying attention to information .
in fact , public media is not as much remote or not doing it .
so , of course , we 're going to eat , and that 's something that 's something that we 've gone from the media , we think of the future we 're going to use .
and we 're going to get the good old divide again .
however , just as a form of the <unk> .
that means we 're going to put about a hundred <unk> units in the winter , which , some of you know that , <unk> , when it comes to the <unk> .
it was a lot of it .
you might know what three times is that , again , once a little bit , even a long time , even a little bit .
i do n't know anymore .
we 're going to do this today , with all of the things we have in this place , so , on the <unk> , about facebook , about twitter , about the radio <unk> , the tv and the way over the internet and the local media and so forth , and it 's still with <unk> , and it 's still with <unk> , and ultimately , to continue the information further .
and we know , we have to be there very quickly and <unk> , and we have to look very quickly and <unk> , because the dying and citizens are going to do other .
and we do n't eventually think that we want to say what we want .
communication in the crisis or in the disaster , there 's a question of <unk> all media who are available to , and it 's a question of <unk> .
now , the biggest problem , because the aid and citizens are going to say , well , the nurses once again , it 's not , or they say , it 's much worse than it is in reality .
so we 've done some good experiences with facebook and twitter , and we 've done a lot of time recently .
and you may have some of them in the media .
we have had a bigger <unk> in food .
and it 's a so-called chemical phone .
these are bombs of the ones who are punched with a <unk> camera , because the only thing that 's not before the first step on the <unk> stage , but in the ground in the second world war , and only the ground in the second world war , and the <unk> <unk> two <unk> of each other was separated , and then she returned to the explosion .
the problem is just a lot of those bombs never works and they 're in the front of other things in the front of other .
and there 's a older gentleman who 's his conscience , as he wanted to go to the protocol , we were now , he 'd seen `` it was like she 'd like <unk> , '' he was like <unk> , and now he 's leaving the authorities that 's a bomb .
by the way , several old ladies came all over the <unk> .
we 're going to see what we can find .
these bombs have got to immediately , <unk> , not <unk> , but it 's being used .
and so we 're just in the <unk> park , and it 's an urgent , in fact , a bomb let 's have a <unk> .
and in the history of the city , the whole communication and twitter are going to run on facebook and twitter , and twitter , the whole round of the whole month <unk> were far out of <unk> <unk> .
and the media was excited . it 's in the background .
we had to do with things that , but they have <unk> and <unk> , everything about mysticism and twitter .
all of the sudden had a great effect for us , because the <unk> will become clear up the social media .
just so , you have to give me a sign of if i 'm supposed to stop .
i ca n't look at this in the clock .
that 's the distribution of that , because first of these social media have the advantage they 're going to focus on .
not so much <unk> , because the members are tweeting in the <unk> , or the <unk> you 're calling them , a high family .
second , fast illustrations .
if anything is n't true , it 's something that the <unk> that i 've talked about , that 's all going to be very clear , because the whole community is essentially the middle of the job .
and it 's a very high lot of that , so if something is wrong , then it can be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going
and we have a huge <unk> .
i said yes , <unk> , who found the exciting thing , like a bomb on the <unk> park .
so , we have the things that happened in the last few years , and it 's much more more urgent than the <unk> of a know , as a result of a white .
again , the city can now eat from such a <unk> home .
a bomb that has to be able to be in an park , certainly not one such .
but it can also be found , and then we 're just doing it afterward , and then we 're going to get there with your <unk> and try to do that in seven feet .
and when they think about the data , think about other cities , if they 're going to get it , because they 're just a so-called <unk> , which you ca n't even recognize , and you know , we 're going to have a variety of houses of the houses , and you 've got no longer look like before .
and to communicate with this , it 's important to be a <unk> , on a world of applying <unk> , to do communications , to make communications , to make sure that the people are capable of being able to get into this difficult situation .
and social media also helps us to be allowed , because ultimately they all have to be involved in communications , and it 's not just a <unk> combination , and the more <unk> is the big part .
so today , today , not only a task of government or a <unk> of the hospital or the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the
and <unk> it has shown .
there 's over twitter , and over facebook , you know , the aid of the help , when partly as you get <unk> , because suddenly , people want to build any <unk> , and you did n't know at all where the <unk> are .
this shows , there 's a lot to do for public communication in the <unk> , but the unprecedented improvement with the <unk> and the <unk> , which is the social media from a <unk> , from a communication standpoint , no longer be able to think more .
and i hope that i 'm convinced that this medium , which is that this is the medium that 's actually used for the good things of life , even in <unk> , and that we 're being used to the city for the most efficient things , this instrument in the future , and the same kind of truth in the future , and the same kind of truth in the future , and the same kind of truth in the future , and the same kind of truth in the future , and the same kind of truth in the future , and the same kind of truth in the future , and the same kind of truth in the future , and the same kind of truth in the future , and the same kind of truth in the future , and the same kind of truth in the future , and the same kind of truth in the future , and the same kind of truth in the future , and the same kind of truth in the future , and the same kind of truth in the future , and the same kind of truth in the future , and the same kind of truth in the future , and the
thank you .
that 's a beautiful good evening .
i 'm a <unk> different .
i 'm a writer and <unk> , and you 've just heard .
and i 'm now now now making your household address .
what it is , i 'm going to make it harder , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i 'm going to think about it in the same way .
before i do that , i have to put some things a few things .
the first is , i think we need stories to live .
we could n't live without stories .
and i think , i believe that there are very much more precise , <unk> , <unk> stories , as the entertainment process is actually being produced .
and then i think that the internet is infinite , which is infinite , and actually as any <unk> , is really <unk> right .
and so , i 've convinced , i think , was convinced that people were being creative .
and they 're happier , as soon as you can be creative .
the more people are happy , the better we go to the world .
all of that .
now , this is a better world , but now it 's a circuit .
in first line , i 'm saying , `` a storyteller , ''
and the story i want to share with is starting with midnight in a context , in the moment , i 'm reading the moment .
that 's <unk> .
and it 's <unk> 's birthday 's birthday .
now , you get the <unk> , and you do n't sing anything like this , because in the moment it 's gone to it , is something that 's going to happen with you .
it 's happening in your head in your body , with your perception .
and she did n't really have to be for a word .
they do n't know what 's happening .
i have a word for that .
i call this the wizard wizard of <unk> .
you can see the one hand and <unk> in <unk> and everything is quite black .
i feel like i 'm sort of a sort of <unk> .
<unk> .
and on the other hand , we have a lot of color in the country , and it 's very much color in the country .
and it 's in this place that i would have said , i 'm better and writing than that .
so , the first thing that 's happening with your new perception is an alien man with <unk> hair hair , who stands to her , she 's very serious about and saying : thank you to look your life .
that 's <unk> .
and kiva.org of evolution of this is that they 're not going to have a very special thing from people .
she was born as a <unk> .
players are people who have to play your life in time .
who knows it ?
very nice .
imagine if the killing of the world 's killing does n't get away when you meet , you 're going to meet your pocket .
so , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , everything possible .
what really matters is the players do n't have a straightforward insight on your face .
we do n't know when we die .
i wish every one long life , however , you just know .
it can be all over the morning .
and so it 's as good as my players are .
they do n't know , to how much they can play .
that means , every previous previous possible minute could be the last one .
a player who has its whole lifetime of monopoly , <unk> on the moment of the <unk> like a candle that 's <unk> .
now , you can ask , well , if that 's as dangerous , why are that all ?
and the answer is quite clear : that 's what it 's like .
it 's no play , without a player , <unk> , everything <unk> and only when a player plays a player , it 's actually alive .
they were born for games .
that 's like that .
this story of <unk> and how they 're now <unk> the world of the player , to give your first challenges , and of course , in love , that 's the story i want to share .
and it 's in form of a <unk> .
the first one is 12 , she 's so sure , i 'm a <unk> here i am in my first time .
so , 12 , in the first way , with a length of time , about five to seven minutes .
this kind of thing that we have , a series of the other , beautiful <unk> , that you know .
the tv power for his host for his host of nowhere else .
that 's not new .
and if it 's all about , i 'm now ready to be here .
and also , not here .
now it 's just a right thing .
let 's take back to more glass .
what is the most famous sentence , from the film , or out of the series ?
it can just be one .
thank you .
as if we had practiced .
and that 's exactly what my players are not .
there 's lots of people who are all about .
there 's so many different games .
think about <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so on and so forth .
and the same thing as a result is the number of players .
and so , some of the stories are every one of the stories that want to be told .
now , the next question : who 's all telling you ?
i 've got a quite high love of me .
i think that 's smart , smart and unhappy creative .
but i know that a hundred brains produce more than just one , even if it 's mine .
and that came out to the idea that you have the crowd to the creative process .
what if we just just unravel , or even bollywood ?
so when you say , we invite you all of your own , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , to create the evolution of this auditorium system .
imagine , for example , in the way , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
and they 're a big fan of <unk> .
and you 're just able to do it with the technology today , that 's not so heavy , a <unk> .
and this store is that it comes on the bark , where it 's right , and that 's what 's really cool , which is really interested in the very interesting thing .
that means , it 's not somewhere in the way , but it 's just the right where it 's supposed to end .
the really beautiful thing is that we are on the internet .
and in the internet , you can really do everything .
so , every medium of medium is kind of allowed .
that 's what you can write as the viewer , draw , turn , you know , you know , whatever they want .
and if we look at this structure , we look at this structure .
this looks a little bit of <unk> web , or it 's a little bit of <unk> , right ?
this is what it is building together .
and i 'm really troubled by being convinced that the internet was born , to tell exactly this kind of stories .
and not only , unfortunately , not so many , not yet .
so now , let me go and get one more step further and let the audience become the player .
and one of the things in a <unk> .
you can skip out of characters from the series of the series , but also for people in the real environment , which have also also <unk> these balloons on your cell phone .
<unk> , which you know , they 're all very good , are like mobile <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
these are the wonderful areas that are going to be very rapidly .
and i ca n't go to , because i would take another one more minutes .
we 're once holding together together .
each one of it is three parts .
the first part is the <unk> , the second part of the <unk> , and then we have the <unk> .
with this session i could have the judges of the day , i could be able to think about this , i was going to be able to tell you the moment : the <unk> innovation .
they gave me the first price for the best possible .
and i have to say , this particular will followed from the banks from banks , from the <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
so , to people , you should say .
and if i can do that , here with my internet , the internet is really , sort of , the way , the world 's point , the world 's point , i think , can i do it , i really can convince everybody .
that 's like that .
everyone 's up , why does this matter well ?
because it 's already turned out in this name all the way .
so we have the <unk> : who 's on , i 'm the one , and you 're on , you 're on , you 're on , you 're on , you 're on , you 're on .
and then , of course , we then die .
it 's been a lot of a series of a lot of people .
everyone is , everybody means , everybody needs to die .
and then , of course , every one of you can ever come if he wants to do that .
that 's totally important .
i 'm going to get out of the <unk> , and there 's nothing worse than i think , as if it 's going to be a <unk> .
i do n't know if you know .
if you 're in the theater , and then you get this actor , you know , the actor and all like , oh , oh , please me .
and that 's not just what it is .
so , of course , volunteers volunteers .
and no one needs .
it can be just viewer .
the reason i 'm talking about is that the whole thing is going to be in the german as well .
that has some reasons a couple of reasons .
i 'm a project <unk> time on my way , and i got to ask : do you go to english , to make better , blah , blah .
and i can just say , the german <unk> is the third of the world .
the <unk> is the english , and then comes up and then the german .
so , it 's not that way we 're going to move ourselves into any small scale .
and i think , i really believe that if it 's also other people as i 'm going to be grateful , that people will not be grateful , where at the end of every <unk> and every <unk> .
so , if this is all this way i 'd like to have , then the first step is now the first step online now .
and if you ask , why i 'm now here , i 'm now in a <unk> , where it 's under the <unk> of the brain 's <unk> .
and i also made some thoughts .
i love back-of-envelope calculations .
not just <unk> .
i 'm also quite sensitive to the <unk> and <unk> .
some architectures , and it was a couple of <unk> rides .
and i can just say that this whole knowledge is incredibly important and incredibly <unk> .
but it does n't use it to do it unless you do n't .
and my project is just <unk> , where i just have been doing everything i 've learned .
and it 's done .
and so , it 's good .
i can just say that .
so if you think about it , i 'm really interested in my part , i had a very high character , or i 'm playing `` i <unk> cartoon , '' or whatever it is , which is the problem .
you 're just found out on the internet .
on facebook .
so , oh , the speaker , speak ,
yes , i 'm also too .
so you can get some memory out of memory ?
question .
you can make some memory ?
can you remember what life is going on in your life ?
have you remember the moment ?
who else remember ?
there 's no hands up .
so you can memories are <unk> out ?
it seems to be .
thank you very much .
no , so , we do n't want to do today .
and then the talk is a little bit short .
again , good evening , my name is samuel <unk> .
the talk today tonight i 've chosen is because he 's two of my passions or my two big work .
i 've studied the very thing here in the near world , and i 'm just doing myself with bits of bits and the bits of the world today fly so far through the world .
and i 'm also doing a lot of coach and a drug cone in private field and <unk> field .
so on the one hand , i 'm looking at the computer with the computer , on the other hand , i 'm now in the human <unk> <unk> , so , how does this help human ?
so how do you change the difference ?
that 's what it 's going to present .
i was a very interesting discussion about artificial intelligence , <unk> off .
so , the question was , when can we build a computer that works like the human brain ?
that 's what i 'm going to do is , and i already have quite close to it .
so , i think , for two hundred years , longer does n't need any time .
but let me just go to you , why you might have a little bit about this thing .
so the computer is between the computer , between the computer , and our brain on the other side .
when we take the computer , it 's all your smartphone , your tablet , your <unk> , your <unk> , and you can also have these cameras , and all of the smart entities have a chip on the <unk> little chip .
it 's called <unk> , central .
these are parts of a small transistors .
the word has never heard of any one , and in <unk> , it 's always going to be as a triangle .
the <unk> little device has three layers of rice and homes , and it does n't happen by or not .
in our own computer , we have , i have <unk> , about five hundred hundred , about five hundred of these small units .
and they 're getting out of this .
we 're doing things we 're talking about , we had things degrees , we have to hear about `` <unk> '' can be a very high , but actually , he can only compare zero and a hydrogen .
that 's not what he can do .
he 's quite a toxic place .
let 's compare it with your brain .
our brain has a tiny bit of the smallest cost of neuron , which means that , and we 've got a <unk> , a hundred billion neurons , and so there are a hundred billion neurons in the gray center here .
the beauty is , our neurons do n't just three connections to get to <unk> per neuron .
and that makes a <unk> <unk> of the world just because it 's beautiful , 10 trillion .
that 's 10 to a month of 14 .
so , there 's the complexity of the brain that 's better than what we have now and have as computers .
if we want to compare the <unk> , maybe the one of the first supercomputer , that they had your own business 's brain , the <unk> , and with the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the campus <unk> .
and our <unk> <unk> is sometimes , but the box here takes about 20 watts .
and the main thing about the equivalent of two great bananas , so you do n't need you to do and you 're going to be beautifully wonderful .
now , if we now look at a big toy , <unk> some good computer with <unk> , why do n't we use the most why do we do things ?
maybe one or other that sort of flipped that bridge on the internet , so the human being only 10 percent of its brain , you can buy this <unk> to the final brain .
and <unk> , and you 're very <unk> with this .
ten percent yes , but our brain is yes , in the process of our evolution , that has been <unk> , it has escaped , but in the middle , there 's another one in the middle of the <unk> in the middle , but it 's all the other chairs .
that 's not happen in the way that we do n't use it .
why is it that we let the biggest part of that ?
maybe you know the term of the <unk> ?
and i 'm standing on the blue of the bird when you look at the bird , in the ocean , you 're going to see the sun , then the surface comes down , the bottom is a <unk> .
and those 10 percent , which is about what our world is , our <unk> mind , but it 's <unk> percent , which runs a giant <unk> .
we <unk> the statement we clearly refer to us , we have <unk> <unk> , we have to have strategic creative .
and to put out <unk> on this memory , maybe one or other people with your memory .
people who smokes looked at a lot more detail than i do n't have seen , and then you 're not seen , where do you know ?
this is where there 's all over the whole thing , there 's a special , a <unk> , a <unk> , somebody who has a <unk> , somebody who has a <unk> , who has a plane , and you 're now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now <unk> , and then , rome , to draw a <unk> sign of the sun , and started to draw .
and it 's not kind of like this , and it 's this thing that 's like this , and it 's this , no , every house , every single door , every single door , he has seen it , he has <unk> , could put it again .
so where does this come from ?
so why can we do n't , well , the most likely that you 're very close to the argument , the approval of the <unk> has gone to its <unk> percent .
now , we 're now using the most popular story , but why ca n't i remember the <unk> last night , in all the details ?
so , <unk> <unk> of me has some interesting experiences .
he even had a place in the center of the center , and it has been designed with a minister that had been used to experience the experience , which was not what 's driving , the <unk> <unk> of the brain , that 's not what 's going on .
wonderful , so i realized that was very good .
now , it 's about making people 's <unk> .
and she 's in a very safe interview , in the end or after this event , even if you could n't remember anything , then you could see the hallmark of the car in which these guys were n't on the same person , that would have been the state of the feet .
and indeed , with this quest , one of the people have been .
the second thing i found was really amazing , it was a lady in <unk> , who told her mother was always helped to be a <unk> in the <unk> than she was , she was a little bit , so four years .
and she sat on her mother her mother and her mother .
and then he said , in the upper , and he said , in the face ,
and then she started to read it , she was four than that , she could n't read at the time , and you could n't read that , and you could n't read it back .
and then she said , `` well , let me tell me the <unk> . ''
you 've actually found a specimen of alice in the <unk> where exactly the car was the text , the lady read .
so the brain has this page , and so it was <unk> , as a picture .
and then , they could read it .
so , we actually are getting access to , but we seem to say that in ordinary life , we 're not going to have to have the same kind of <unk> that we do n't care about .
now , we now store the incident in yourself , but as the <unk> said , he has seen a picture , which is a <unk> , we store our sense , so what we 're saying , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're seeing , what we 're
and , it was now a long evening , put a little bit of a <unk> , and you can <unk> , you know , close , close , close , close , close , close , close , close , close , close , just a little bit of eyes .
and remember , a very , very , positive event in the telecommunications past , yes .
take the first one , take a look at what 's coming .
and if you do that now , you might be aware of this memory , you know , to be a visual part .
you may have a picture , maybe even a movie ?
some of you do n't just think of that , because we do this so normal , but that 's what they 're doing is to be aware of that .
and if you see that , then you 're either in the movie of your eyes , or you can see , or you can see your eyes on a canvas .
we call <unk> that we call the other <unk> .
thank you very much , you can actually solve the idea back , you can solve the eyes again .
who 's a visual information , you know ?
yes , there 's a couple of hands up , that 's what i think is about this , which is about what i think is , that 's about what we 're expecting , it 's about what we 're expecting is that we do n't think about the first moment .
well , take the <unk> on the ground .
but what 's nice is on memories when you 're practicing memory , it 's not just that memory , <unk> feels like this , we 're not going to be able to make sense of our memory , or other emotions .
and now , what 's exciting .
and all of that was before , well , that our brain does n't make any difference between what we actually remember , and what we 're just thinking about what we were looking at .
and you can try and do that if they 're sitting at home , and you think something you can think of it , you 're going to put similar information , if you remember what 's in the past .
and , you know , you 're supposed to have these stories that you 've been told in <unk> , from the back of the time .
then , hey , there 's this thing that 's happening , and that 's nice , and the more pictures of the stories , the more , the more , the other thing , the more beautiful , the more , the more , the other guys , hey , there was a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot more .
if we do that , if we do that , if we do n't make our memories so , why do we do this because i 'm going to ask you ?
<unk> , when i came here , my uncle showed up a picture , which was buried in switzerland .
it 's a very beautiful image , it 's a very nice shack .
it 's just joking , because it 's just a good dog , and it 's a beautiful dog , that 's the sun on the alps , that 's a picture of this hut , that 's not a picture of this hut , that 's true of this hut , at the alps .
and why do we do this , and we 're not going to take this on our own thoughts , but what else does that , if i do that , i think there 's a degree that i think there is a degree ?
you 've actually got to be artistic freedom in your own thoughts .
you know , `` some people , who you see in the morning you 're seeing when you just have that gray eyes , what 's going on ?
i slept for love , i went to the whole <unk> through my head .
really , the whole night and that thought did n't let me go .
i think it 's the other thing he did n't stop .
the son <unk> friend of me receives little depressed than he came to germany , because he stayed on the <unk> , and he was just awful .
what the dad did , he 's got up with the son , and she said , or did , like , what was the most beautiful thing today ?
what was the most beautiful , tell , and then he got him back , he did it , let him tell you what has happened today .
and then two weeks , he was doing the son .
and then , in fact , that 's the way that the driver are gone back to visit .
and the one is today that the whole adolescence is about this , which is one of the smartest people i know .
so it 's not the memories that influence us , where we are , but it 's our focus on what the ideas we use .
and how much energy we can use on to use or use .
so if you 're <unk> <unk> , you know , that 's shown today , that 's like the practice , you may know , `` tom editor , '' you know , tom 's <unk> , you know , tom 's <unk> , you know , tom 's <unk> , you know , tom 's <unk> , you know , `` tom editor , '' he 's like , `` you know , tom 's <unk> , '' he 's up , you know , tom 's <unk> , you know , tom 's <unk> , you know , `` tom editor , '' he 's like , `` you know , tom 's <unk> , '' he 's up , you know , tom 's <unk> , you know , `` tom editor , '' he 's like , `` you know , tom 's <unk> , '' he 's up , you know , tom 's <unk> , you know , `` tom editor , '' he 's like , you know , tom 's <unk> , you know , `` tom editor , '' but i 'm going to do tom 's <unk> , you know , you know , tom 's <unk> , you know , `` tom editor , '' but , <unk> , gone .
what do we mean , `` oh , '' oh , what beautiful , is n't it , <unk> , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , that was
and then you take it with it .
take that with your <unk> and let 's go .
or if you get somebody else 's <unk> , you 're <unk> your boss , or your wife , or her husband , you know , you laugh , you know , you laugh .
so , take this image , put some noise on it , you know , `` you know , `` you know , `` you know , `` you know , `` you know , `` you know , `` you know , `` you know , ``
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , let 's jump out in the background of a <unk> , yeah , why are you laughing ?
because they 're <unk> these thoughts that are fun .
and they can handle a lot of good ways to do it .
so can some of your memory pop up ?
no , i believe that our brain has so much so much so much so much that it can store .
it does n't matter because we can choose to choose to choose to the focus , how much we can focus on , and how important we thought , a memory , a memory , a memory , it 's coming up .
my <unk> in you , they play it with the pictures in your head , using the power of your <unk> and give them a daily <unk> that you can do with them .
yes , good afternoon .
thank you very much for meeting .
if i ask a party on a party , what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to make a <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and i see shining eyes and i 'm going to see shining eyes and i 'm going to see you grab the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
if i 'm assuming that it 's a real leap for classical music , and you 'll push these coins <unk> images of old people who are in just long <unk> in <unk> rooms and very focused on art .
now , frank <unk> said to talk about architecture , so i think about architecture .
and so much like this , that 's what we 're doing .
so , you know , you can get a glimpse of what i 'm going to do right now , i have a video clip .

and it 's really a broken , and it 's a fantastic issue .
that 's what it takes from my view of the best end .
and then , the problem of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the
we 're going to be so between <unk> and the middle , and now , 20 old , and have very early in our youth , which incredible power and joy .
but we also have experienced that the phrase of the <unk> , and the <unk> of us , some joy , well , a little bit of date .
and we 're the belief that the belief that the so-called action does not tell the classical music , the content itself , so on the music itself , but it 's their favorite <unk> .
so let 's imagine the question , how can we create a <unk> that the friends and the <unk> again , that we like so much of it .
how do we organize a <unk> program that works beyond the spacecraft 's disintegration ?
we are asking the parameters that they know from the classical concert , space , time , lights , the context , fundamentally , in question .
so let 's take the relationship between the audience and musicians .
normally it 's between the stage and the audience a divide .
we 're trying to share the joint .
here you see a picture of our <unk> .
the musicians in the audience , drink beer , are moving into the corner with the worse , and then they 're going to play , you play , two pieces , sit again in the audience .
all of the evening is a bit of a <unk> in the evening .
anybody who 's looking at is coming up and goes back .
or that 's the seat in concert .
in the classical concert , it 's like you 're on more or less comfortable , you get it , so like you here , sit and you 're listening .
but there 's music , you 're actually not still ready .
and we have thought to what can do it .
if you 're looking for different , and you can actually be able to sit at a <unk> piece of music , you hear automatically differently .
and it 's coming on that concert , but four stages in the audience .
the audience could have been <unk> .
so , everybody was looking at the first row of the evening every week .
what matters is that we do n't just do any of us , but that 's why we think about thinking .
so that we ask ourselves , what are the spaces and the world of the human world , but also the same in the minds of the human beings is that they can be so much like they want to go ?
and then , at night , at night , at night , in the <unk> , <unk> at night , 30 , <unk> , which is actually only <unk> by <unk> , in clubs , in the old rock .
but not only is the spaces of the spaces and the lighting can be alive and are now , but also the connection with others .
and so we 're very happy that we 've been working with the <unk> that we 've been doing with the <unk> and become a force to become music to the detriment that actually has n't been written for the dancing .
and this is how <unk> <unk> for <unk> of beethoven or for <unk> of steve reich .
and in this year , we have one , yes , yes , yes , yes , it wants to be <unk> .
we first had a concert with a <unk> performance .
we have the story of the soldier from <unk> <unk> <unk> with actors , and the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that 's what it works , because we had a big <unk> that works in that piece .
we have a lot of money from people from completely germany , so we could pull that .
at least this one , it 's something that comes out of a community .
we 're totally happy in the <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
the town is exactly as big as we find it , and we find it very well , but also so small that we are doing noise .
if the last year in the spring century , we have two weeks of <unk> <unk> in the town , just in the city , is just that in the city , more people rated more than they do .
the whole thing that we have is managed to do is it 's made on the entire physical system .
we 're hiring a stimulus that made a stimulus train from students and students , the <unk> , <unk> , really completely mixed .
and to make a <unk> <unk> that 's like the <unk> or coordination and funding in the eye , <unk> seven to 10 , 10 , a year , a few more mature task .
that 's the same way , but they 're worried about a year that 's the <unk> or the <unk> , the snack in the surface of hands are hands and to become the <unk> .
we all make it all of our leisure and lives in all germany .
that means the biggest part of the work is going to be entrepreneurial and on a third-world line .
only three times in the year , we 're meeting over the year to a <unk> , <unk> , to talk about the <unk> or other problems that showed them , and also the human thing that 's really amazing is what 's really important is what 's really important if you want to be in motion motion .
and then you get 20 to 30 volunteers , who come for a few days or a few weeks , your hands and could push your help to the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and of course , in those 14 days , the musicians are doing .
now , you could have to have this idea of that , you could have a chance to do everything .
but we still <unk> .
we have a lot of community in <unk> in the city , and we have a big community around us that we want to make us what we want to do .
this is what the leader of the classical action is , but also , above all of practical things like this , because of the way we have a baker , who has a bread of a bread , or a <unk> that has been making fresh foods .
the tera system is going to have done in a store in the city , and he sells over the whole year .
and then they 're <unk> .
we 've found a whole range of private companies that can make us their living living living living living living living living living living in the next place so that can be operated there .
and on this kind of thing , the role of this is going to become something which has become something which has become a little bit of it and the people in this city .
they identify in a very particular way of this floating .
and for the beginning of year , we could have <unk> support of the citizens in a <unk> , and they have now call the entire event on a <unk> and a <unk> and <unk> .
we 're asking by the fact that classical music is , they get to come up in the right hands .
so we 're incredibly happy about that in all of europe , the young musicians music in their own hand and start in the cities , in the cities , in the cities ,
now if you 're still able to imagine the right now , like , looking at what you feel like , you just get over .
we 're going back to the <unk> , and we would look at us if they 're there .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learn .
you might think of it .
you know , you know , to learn to learn or to learn , but i mean , much more than i 'm getting far more than the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> .
you know , know , experience <unk> , a beautiful formula for the <unk> .
what i learned from art and culture , well , i can tell a lot of natural , because now , i 'm going to be able to do this , because of this field , i 'm going to have this field .
and so i think that perhaps , i think , this is something that might be a little <unk> word for a whole talk .
art is beautiful , but it 's a lot of work .
you 've also met anyone now .
you always get the laughter , even though most of the tricks .
why is this ?
i think that this has to do with that word beautiful , which we can not capture .
art , that 's what we sometimes say , that 's what we sometimes .
so to do that , we 're saying that , that 's what we 're saying .
sometimes .
the people who want to work , that 's what i want to work .
but work we think about the <unk> and the art that 's more than the realm of the realm of the realm of the realm of the realm of the realm of the realm of the realm of the realm of the realm of the world , where we move ourselves to our experiences , our own ideas .
and i have my favorite message that i want to share with you now , in about three hours , divided the headline , with a me , so that 's what it starts to do with it .
it starts with the people who 's looking for childhood , and i 'm not going to tell you all of my youth , no concern , go on , and then i 'll tell you all of my youth , no concern , go on , and then i 'll tell you all the way to talk about the word `` i 'm going to take it to my <unk> . ''
interaction for the first part of my professional life and eventually , fifth , whatever .
you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
<unk> , two and <unk> .
you learn that in the first two , three years , if you 're a practice , and i 've been doing a lot of times .
and i have a lot of time , i played these little pieces on the piano , not far from here , at the <unk> , at home .
these pieces live by a <unk> .
there 's a melody and played and the other voice <unk> , but it 's very different .
the rhythm is the same , but it 's <unk> .
and that , ladies and gentlemen , is something that is something that is a really important thing , that it 's , and if it only are two voices , <unk> , to think about whether the present , the future , the future , in <unk> , pictures , in the moment , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> ,
and i learned two to do , sometimes three , to play with the <unk> <unk> , at the same time , to play any way to play with , to play any way of the one you , but that 's not the other .
that was what i learned about , among other things .
and so the experience i did n't forget , and i have had the worry that i could also be even so much of it .
i have a piano , and there was more people in the room than today , and in the middle of the year , i got out of it .
i had forgotten it .
i did .
so again , and i did n't really know the same spot , and i did n't really know again .
the audience has more than more than i , because i went on to my place , my grades , put it out and started the third one .
and you do n't think about how to give me up to me .
but that was a very heavy experience .
maybe that was one of the experience where i knew , well , with no piano , even though i had a <unk> , i do n't think , because i do n't cheat to my <unk> , because , in talk , you 're lighter ,
yes , the next chapter i 've got , i 'm talking about <unk> with inspiration , and i want to tell you stories .
when i was so <unk> , i went to my <unk> and i said , `` she was mr. <unk> , i 'd like to play a <unk> play .
and he said , `` well , that 's not what it 's .
and you have to have visited many <unk> of <unk> and lots of experience with women .
now , imagine a <unk> young man , so young , so that 's a sentence .
i did n't forget that .
and from that point , i 've got more even more .
now , i was a way of the way , and i was looking at a <unk> .
i 've looked at what i would remember , i remember , i remember , i remember , i would have noticed .
it was the reckless <unk> of the chopin , and now i 'll get into the part of the work , i just have to do it , and she was the most beautiful place , and then again , and then again , and again , again , and again , and again , and again .
i ca n't play it , is not a piano here , and i could n't do it .
i was taking this place 20 , 30 times a little bit , and suddenly she came right .
and then i went and <unk> , i was going to go to a <unk> , and i just know that i was eating myself on the ground and laughing .
i was , i was .
i had nothing , nothing done , and the music did this with me .
so , a experience where i learned , is really , emotions , really , really .
and sometimes it 's right now to work with this , you call it <unk> in this condition , in this condition , i call it , the tooling .
where everything runs .
we had this situation , actually , in the <unk> , we had a <unk> <unk> in the center of the <unk> community .
and then almost everything like this , as we did the same <unk> , that 's only two months , where you would normally need a year .
well , that 's my experiences with the piano , with artistic , and artistic work .
and now i am going to come to my background , <unk> .
i was first sighted as a musician , but it was like a <unk> .
we have played <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
i gave a <unk> , and i have been doing this , because i was going to love my name for music and the <unk> .
in the choir , in a split , breathing , a <unk> , wonderful experiences that i have very , very further .
and then a point came up with where i went to <unk> , in the <unk> , in the <unk> and the government , and i have this sort of thing to do this with <unk> <unk> , this chapter , because this is the combination of art , the culture , i was also in the <unk> of politics , politics and law enforcement became a profession .
art is the art art to make culture , to make a <unk> .
so , the art here is the art , but not as artists , but it would n't be <unk> , but as a <unk> <unk> and a more and more .
i was there , and i have <unk> , and i had n't even invested in germany , and i was a <unk> , and i 'm on the ground , and i 'm on the ground , and i 'm on the ground , and i 'm on the ground , and i 'm on the ground , and i 'm on the ground , and i 'm on the ground , and i 'm going to talk to this question , and i 'm on the phone , and i 'm going to talk to this question , what can you do art to make art to make art of art to improve art for art to improve the art for art , to make a good management of profit in the process of art .
and that was the reason i was getting out of my professional , in direction this <unk> , and i became <unk> , and i was <unk> .
but before , another <unk> , and that 's what i have done with interaction with interactions .
i was <unk> , for german <unk> .
the german <unk> has its <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm a gamer , even though sometimes in my résumé , because i was born in <unk> , the <unk> oliver <unk> , i 'm sorry about it , i 'll sort of <unk> .
but i have a <unk> root , because my grandparents had been <unk> , and there was a <unk> , and there , in <unk> , i 've had the <unk> .
and i was really fortunate something that i did , and suddenly i was going into another shape of culture in a <unk> , in a culture that was being produced by people in this <unk> device .
once the <unk> of us on the front of us were being moved on us all the time , all of the situation , in the very different states .
and i put up with the <unk> , which is the future <unk> and <unk> <unk> , who i made my friend and colleague , because we 've always done for the <unk> night music , he was left , i was going to get the piano , i could have the piano back to the <unk> .
we did the <unk> <unk> , but of course , on texts of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
and this <unk> , that 's really from people .
it was my destiny that i was at home november november <unk> for my <unk> , and i did n't know that the wall fell .
i was looking at the next day , i had a lot of <unk> , oh , the wall is like , yes .
i still have been prepared for any questions to the <unk> .
and i was <unk> for the cities in the south condition .
and then i 've experienced again , like interactions , in the other , german cultures .
in fact , we 're talking the same language , the music is going to be beautifully and a wonderful , but a lot of a lot of things that were <unk> , <unk> .
unlike the world cup , it 's not from all the people themselves , but it came up with the top of the world , and i have a big conflict here , and you can see how the german identity , and the german <unk> then has come up and the two states of <unk> .
since then germany 's called germany .
since then , again , in the street , far more mature 2.0 .
but in effect , i have learned to all things , and i 've experienced in the city .
we have this kind of evidence that i 'd have found , and i started to think , <unk> , i was standing on my <unk> and <unk> for culture and play .
i still have the job .
`` <unk> '' for <unk> , you did n't want to write a <unk> for culture and <unk> .
i was the first person 's head of the decoy .
so i have n't really been so much so much , so the wonderful thing , i had this sort of <unk> , but they soon were in charge for education and to make alliances to education to education .
we 've done a lot to our urban landscape , we have just given this analog between <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , what we 've designed between , <unk> , <unk> , where you can see interactions between the <unk> and architecture , from the <unk> to the blue sector .
many , many interactions , we could have been able to go and i was doing what that means when different people come from different backgrounds together .
and by the way , you notice that i always get more and more complex of the art , more and more and more of the art , more and more of the time that we care about , in the cultures , in the cultures , and i 'll come back to art afterwards .
interaction , it was between the <unk> of the subject as we , <unk> seven <unk> , the idea that <unk> , the <unk> could hold in the <unk> of the world trade .
but this last chapter , this is the fifth act of the conventional identification .
this word has two meanings to one , i 'm doing something , i 'm doing something , and i can also use it as verb and say , i 'm going to see something that means , i know , i know something .
and it 's always in his <unk> .
i 'm looking at your favorite , so i say , i say , i 'm going to say you , or the one community .
and i 'm doing something that i 'm going to identify with something that 's what i 'm going to identify with me .
and that 's a really big deal .
five major three million people trying to move , <unk> cities , so in the way , to identify the way to identify and realize that you 're a community in europe .
as big , we called it <unk> , but anyway , as a community of many people who live in a big life of life and yet a common language , even when there 's a <unk> nations , and that was our environmental system that acts of the passions and that has a lot of prescription for people .
in the sign , the highway , the highway , the highway , the highway , the highway , the highway , the highway , the highway , the highway , the highway , the highway , the
so , you know , one experience that 's not seen from the <unk> era , not so many people .
and young student from <unk> school , <unk> , young schools , a young girl from <unk> , from the <unk> , young girls from <unk> , from <unk> <unk> , who <unk> letters , young girls from <unk> , <unk> , who said , `` oh , young men , <unk> , <unk> , who wrote the last letter . ''
and it was a curious effect that young girl loved letters from boys and young russians , he <unk> amazement from young men from germany into a little bit of germany .
and then one of those young men sat down the piano , and she was this <unk> i loved .
and then , he quoted out of a letter , and she said , i 'm sure he wrote home , when the young german german he played , and i never play one more thoughtful , because my two fingers are just <unk> .
and he <unk> his finger with a <unk> , he <unk> himself in this piece of <unk> and tried to play the <unk> .
and he did n't even .
it was such a <unk> film that i was <unk> , so , what did we learned about it ?
we 've learned in the finance islands that many people can move together , but in the world , we learned that we have <unk> years in <unk> in peace and the culture that we do n't identify the minds , because we 're discussing to connect ourselves , because we are discussing to ourselves ourselves .
and that was a wonderful experience , and you can see it 's not just about learning to you .
it 's always about learning to be able to get to experience and be <unk> .
and when we 're a lot of power and invention , if we tolerate it that we inspire ourselves from art and culture , to govern our own position , and we 're also going to work with art and culture , and we 've all won with art and culture .
and i hope they have lots of <unk> and <unk> that they pull to this proposition .
thank you very much .
yes , thank you very much .
i think we 'll just do the first image .
so i have to <unk> my way to my point , and i 'm going to give some slides .
but it 's not a scientific thing , but it 's about a theme here , and i think that 's going to have the next generation of specialty .
by the most popular words , i can finally finally , thank you very much for what ted means , and i think in the area , we can have it as well as i 'm not being true .
and then i had heard that you should think of the talk in english , if somehow possible , but if you look at it , you 'll see what i wanted to say english and so i did the talk to german .
we 're going to die .
i have to tell you about this <unk> .
<unk> was a patient in the hospital i was <unk> , and the <unk> .
she was over over <unk> years old , and he likes to be famous in may , because she remembered her husband , the first man who was in war , and then she was in war .
and so she went to the dance , and probably once then <unk> a <unk> <unk> , and then the car , and then you 're standing here on the right side , and you see that the leg burst , the <unk> .
a couple of years before , she was also in the same way , and it was like , before , it appeared to broken the left leg .
and then i was also there as a doctor and i 've been , how she was in the late care , as she was treated with antibiotics , and have the discussion , which was all that sense ?
does it make it sense to make such a kind of useful people using this kind of intense model ?
so , the beginning , the <unk> , on the intensive care , is that one of the one humans ever <unk> ?
and she has been cured .
five years later , i 'll get the clinic , looking at the name of the name , and i can remember the way , because it 's so rare for the time , and he circled himself in the other direction .
so , what he is in the question is what i 'm really interested in when i talk about how a human being deciding , what he 's also in his <unk> or what he 's also in the moment of the time ?
and that 's a bit of the subject of this .
you see the <unk> of the <unk> , as we are dying .
it 's a book from <unk> that we 're going to work , a report in the front of the world .
and then , in the time , it was so much powerful , so it 's going to be remembered that , how can it be to work with ?
you have it , and you can also read this , just a quality of the parts , so the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts .
it becomes a relationship of work in the work , it 's going to be a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot more going to be a lot of a lot more going to china , for example , that was a big topic .
and that 's also that in fact , the work of the individuals , which is a little bit , more <unk> , that he used to be increasingly efficient , from the quality that he <unk> , which is what he <unk> , from the accuracy .
and that , after my interaction , people could be able to pull out less and more self-esteem from their work and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and
and if we transmit this , we transmit this spread on the <unk> and medical space , so it 's so much of the time .
if you hear tv in tv , what doctors , nurses and <unk> , most of the educational , it 's the so-called slurry .
and this is not something else , as a result , it 's got to be used to what you have done so it 's <unk> , so it 's paid to it , and if it 's not a natural service , then the medical service , and that medical treatment will not pay them .
and through the stage , the work of the <unk> of the waste of the <unk> increasingly stronger and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more
a good friend of mine is to go to a meeting , because he did n't want to be a <unk> practice that was placed and he went to kenya to become a doctor for <unk> .
the <unk> are , in the same , the same way , a piece of effect , and he 's , the martin , had found that more old people , and then , in the middle of the <unk> , the hospital , and back , because the <unk> did n't know what they should do when they were worse .
then you get into the hospital , then then goes back to your home , or <unk> , and then you 're going to get there .
and this kind of thing was that it was possible if there 's something wrong in the netherlands , then i would like to let me train to let me train to give you to here , to make something a little bit of <unk> that you can crush from this vicious cycle of the <unk> and the <unk> , and the <unk> of people can opt from .
there , in the netherlands , he had to be able to find out after he had to learn , after he had learned the language of what had learned that there was the same thing that was happening in this auditorium .
it 's also becoming increasingly connected to die .
it 's not the <unk> that counts , but you want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the hospital , or not in the hospital when i 'm in the middle of the <unk> .
and then the <unk> system .
in the protocell , it 's like this , the third days is a conversation with the people instead , and then you have to be able to get into the hospital , i want to get a conversation in the hospital when i want something .
right , so that 's what i want to be , or i want to be getting up to be a permanent .
this data is then going to be a central center and it sits on this physician for <unk> , and then they have the <unk> and then the decision on this basis .
now , if we remember <unk> , which i would like to be remembered in may be a republic and then , and we imagine that would have written a band , i want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a <unk> , and then you could have this second dance in may where they 're going to come back and the other , you know , you 'd have this second dance in may where they 're going to come back , you know , you know , you know , no longer experience .
and that 's the moment my friend now , who is standing in the netherlands , as well , as he 's a very much <unk> of how to deal with it .
in hospitals , maybe maybe perhaps <unk> today , about <unk> to 70 percent of the people 's not spending over to 70 percent of the people , but it 's often a narrow conversation tightly , and you can get tightly <unk> at that <unk> , and that 's where i think that 's just limited .
there 's bad gene , which is very good , there are very <unk> people who are flying there but when i look at the <unk> , and we have about <unk> patients in the year , so i would say to myself , it 's hard to cope with his inner self-worth .
all of course , of course , most of the people are introduced , it 's clear , that all the way that all people will be aware of , and the people who care about , you know , i 'm doing good with you , and i can tell you that they say , i 'm doing good with you , and i can tell you that they say , i 'm doing good with you , and i can tell you that they say , i 'm going to say , i 'm going to say , i 'm going to say , i 'm okay , so i can come to be good , because i can get a family of a family or two children .
now , this is n't really the fictional reality , but you need two bites in the <unk> and <unk> and the way it 's just a scarce way .
this introduction of quality control as a result of a whole <unk> marketplace that you want to adjust to , and then you can actually get on the individuals .
and now i 'm going to come to the bottom of the maybe you can get away from the most , because what we do now , because i 've been asking , and i show you , so that 's really simple , the situation for the numbers .
and because i just have the <unk> <unk> , and the paper on me there because i think a society needs to make this structure , also legal structures that we all become so much structure , as well as legal structures that we all society .
and in the <unk> article , one is , that 's where people would be <unk> .
and the second one is , it 's the name of it , is ] the name of all the queries .
and what i lack is , is a third sentence in that , that every single one would be to protect the commission and defend the way to defend it .
because that 's a way to get itself out of this event , i 'll give you to another way , and then i do n't know that to do it , and then i do n't know that to do it , and then i do n't know that to do it , and then i do n't know that to be dying for me .
because at the last , it 's like , even if we 're not like to ask this topic , we 'll be able to get to the point .
hopefully late , with a hundred or a <unk> .
now , of course , i 'm also going to ask the topic , and i want to ask the decision , and i want to ask the subject , and if it 's as far as it is , or just as it is that , or if you 're <unk> , <unk> or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , it can be late in life , i want to think about this question .
now , if you think about what 's going on , then you get to dots where then you get in the last , and then the five most important things in my life ?
there 's a book now , which is a fairly mature <unk> .
it 's the self-esteem of course , there are the friends i have , i 'm linking to talk to you , and i can exchange myself through life , it 's the <unk> .
it 's safe between people that i may have to do with , in the <unk> , or in the personal/social sector , or a minister or a <unk> , or another person i have involved in relationship with .
and there 's many of many of the many individuals that are in the <unk> , and i 'm not all of all of them now .
but if you look at these three points , you 've got a whole lot of tasks , you know , you 've got to live in your life , you 've got to be able to protect your own .
and then another factor of this is that we have a certain sort of dictatorship in the molting experience , i 've got this one like a text or as an example of that .
other people can make these decisions and this behavior , which are <unk> , not .
that 's my inner belief .
and our vehicles can only come out of ourselves .
so , it 's not the question , what will be different to me , who will be a <unk> , or you 're going to pray who 's going to happen ?
it 's just the same way , where can i have to do it , where can i take myself , and i think , my inner network would be , and i can use and play with it .
and then , when you tell how we 're going to work , this sort of <unk> that has been in the rest of the <unk> that 's been in the outside of the road , it 's a possibility , and i 'm going to suggest me about my inner dignity , that 's mechanism , i think about my inner inner model , this mechanism .
because no human beings can be unconscious , as i can tell myself , and you can function .
and i have to do n't fit into general <unk> , or opinions that you 've got to be , you know , you 've got to be celebrating , you know , you 're exactly whether you want to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to
these questions , i can probably edit the last couple of <unk> <unk> .
this would be a inner posture that 's in my mind , and not by outside the state , the state ca n't protect the state , and i can be <unk> when i just have the same time with the <unk> , so that the knowledge is a human being .
and to make these conversations , it takes place , and i think , and that 's why i think this talk about the <unk> , and here , i think , in a picture , these spaces like the <unk> , which is a more credible space , so that 's what it 's not so theoretical , but that 's a conversation that 's not being seen in a conversation .
so , if we 're old , you might say , oh , well , that 's like a dance in may despite my may despite my own , despite my most high age , that would be even more .
thank you very much for your attention .
beautiful evening .
i 'll bring two things to do .
if you 're a part of the first part , you 'll think of a little bit more . ''
it 's still a second .
let 's start with infinite space .
that 's stupid , not .
what do you mean ?
is there different <unk> ?
or is it that 's infinitely enough ?
yeah .
that 's not good when there 's a thing that 's looking at .
so , in fact , i 'll just take it to the people who know it .
we do n't do that .
we just are just using ourselves with one .
and i want to get it to the <unk> .
so , with the <unk> , we know , more powerful form of us to know .
and it 's about the <unk> of the whole from the whole .
if we 're on the road , we 're going to be operating in the back , and we 're going two <unk> , in one of the other people , in the other people .
we know , well , we already look at the box , the number is small , it 's three chairs and there 's three people .
we can see if any of the same number of elements is that ?
so , what would we do it ?
that means , we would just take the people together , one , two , three , we get the chairs , we get the chairs , see three chairs , three chairs , three chairs , three chairs , three chairs , three chairs , three chairs , three chairs , three chairs , three chairs , three chairs , three chairs , three chairs , three chairs , three chairs , three chairs , three chairs , three chairs , three chairs , three chairs , three chairs , three chairs , three chairs , three chairs , three .
that 's what i mean , yeah ?
very nice .
that works in the building , that works in the most important , even though it 's going to be able to do it .
but it 's true .
how do you count it ?
how do you think so many people like us ?
i have consciously forced to silence and people , and not what else .
<unk> !
you call the people .
you know , that 's clear , right , now we 're on the daily side , and you 're all understanding that !
not , that 's very nice .
so , you 've got this <unk> and it works , right ?
you take one , you put a chair out of a chair out of the mouse .
the next thing is , the next thing , the next <unk> , all of it is , several people there , different people , there 's no chair , and the amount of blue are the same , okay ?
now we 're going to go into the infinite system .
how can we compare two infinite amounts of interactions ?
we would say , well , one of the things that we would be like , that 's how big or bigger , or smaller than the other .
we could do it ?
we would begin again .
right , that 's wrong because the point is because the point is because it 's the point when you start in a infinitely long way , yes , i would n't say you 're not going to another .
<unk> , infinitely , is clear , is it , <unk> ?
so , what about it ?
pardon ?
no way , <unk> !
she 'd just started it right .
mate !
so now let 's look at that .
estimate that , you know , you know , you know , is it bad , yes , yes ?
you 're not end , yeah ?
the point is this , you 're doing it all the way .
if i take the most virtuous , natural numbers , the zero numbers , the zero , we 'll have a need to take zero to the beginning , zero , one , two , three , four , five .
and we would have , say , a replica of this cable and we take this video to the <unk> of a lot of <unk> numbers .
you 're just going to stay numbers , okay , zero , two , six , six , six , <unk> ?
okay ?
all the length of the world 's <unk> figures are <unk> on the infinitely long graph of the natural numbers , but on the <unk> of the <unk> , on the other hand , is the straight line and the <unk> on it , okay ?
let 's call that a lot of <unk> the straight numbers , we call the other amount of <unk> numbers .
what do you think ?
is a <unk> powerful , is it bigger than strategy , or smaller ?
right ?
but that 's very common , yes , in the one hand , the <unk> .
who else is that ?
smaller ?
who makes bigger ?
oh , who did n't really plan , yeah ?
so that can not be true , yeah ?
you ca n't , where what is missing , is bigger , that 's not , not ?
okay , so you say , you know , little ?
do you think it 's not ?
that 's the most popular thing you 're supposed to be wrong , of course .
now , now i 'm telling you why the number is equal .
how does it work ?
right .
yes , we mate .
that 's the point .
we mate .
we take the zero away from the big crowd , we take the zero from the natural crowd , mate out .
the next one of the zero , after plus two comes two , you can see two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , one , and i 'll get a <unk> .
the four , the six , the six , the eight , yes ?
you can also turn that , you will be off , that 's clear , is n't it ?
and it 's very clear through the <unk> , and it 's what i 'm always doing it in the lecture like a <unk> <unk> .
and here one , because there 's just the straight line on it , and the <unk> is the same long , right ?
we <unk> the natural one on the straight line , <unk> , the <unk> are gone and the band is still in the same way .
that 's just infinite .
so if you explain some of those , what we 've learned today today has learned , yeah , what 's infinite , i just know ?
a infinity amount has a property , which is there 's not in the course , and that property is absolute , is a real economy that 's the same thing .
you do n't get to do that in the course when you 're from three people two people two people , then only one there , and it 's three .
yes , so we did pull together .
is n't nobody <unk> ?
okay .
then we do another bit of it , probability .
the professionals , the number of probability .
so what brought up here .
now , at this experiment , i 'm sure , at least , at least , at least , is at least a third , and you will ask it to someone who has it on it , right ?
so , let 's call the doors a , b , c .
i was hidden under anything hidden , i hope you 've not heard .
and you 're going to guess now .
where do you know , i 'm looking at something hidden behind a , b or c ?
guess what you 're here , our <unk> , here .
they 're probably choosing .
who else has another idea ?
a ?
who 's still a scheme ?
it 's a little bit , `` b , b is not , but not any of you who never hear that , <unk> ?
that 's right .
it 's really not really wrong , so you do n't have to break out the three letters and i 'm looking for me .
it 's really wrong , yeah ?
it 's totally clear because , it 's the chance they have a very lucky luck , is it 's just a third .
so , you have three things , it 's really wrong , yeah ?
now i do this , i just do one .
well , i know where it is .
<unk> , that 's somebody who has a lot of guitar .
so , i know where it 's , and the best thing , or whatever you call it , go to a second round .
so i really now now now now share the game now , i 'm now now sending a lot now .
so it 's like this , we go to a second round .
now , supposing i 'm on the one , i 'm reading it .
so now i have to show a door behind it , behind it , and they do n't say .
because , if you 're saying b , and i say , well , it 's not behind b .
then there would be no two round .
i 'll say , <unk> , who had trouble out of the mouse ,
but i have to think , this is <unk> , where the second round .
so i can only have one open behind that it 's not only not only , but what they do n't say .
now , the question is , and that 's the number of probability that 's in the condition , is that b is open , and it 's not behind it , you 've got your last chance to guess new .
now , you can stay with a stay , then i 'm going to have a <unk> .
i do this , i do what they want .
or you say , i 'm going to make c .
now , is the <unk> economy , is it that 's now being more than that knowledge ?
so , very beautiful , b is , now it 's behind c .
or , god is that b , is , i wanted to stay with a stay , that 's it .
or , you know , it 's <unk> , we have <unk> , we have two doors , now it 's not really inevitable or to stay .
what do you mean ?
it 's not anyway .
<unk> .
why is n't it anyway ?
very nice .
why is it why is it <unk> ?
yes , exactly , that 's wrong .
now , that 's almost like , when we had a phone <unk> , <unk> ?
but that 's how they are , they 're a new no , fun .
so , the thing is quite a game , yes .
you know , all of that , you know , six , and yeah , yeah , i ca n't be <unk> , can i do n't get any more , <unk> ?
so , it 's really happening .
behind this one , it 's up to a third .
and it 's just to a third behind one door .
you can guess what you want , you have two thirds care in the bathroom .
that means , you could have guess about two doors , not , you can do that , you can make it on two dozen , then you 're <unk> , you know , if you were the zero times , that 's all in the correct life .
but here , we just have one door .
so , this is what you 're doing is .
so the two third here here is , but it 's just behind one door .
behind the problem !
so , what else is that ?
no way , i really hidden it .
so , what is more than more than more than more than more than more than ?
it 's better , too , to move ?
now it 's just , yes ?
yeah , of course !
so , that 's not hard to do ,
ha !
what do we see ?
they have been out .
why ?
very simple , it 's two thirds of one , and it 's not a hundred percent : the difference between the theory and practice .
i hope it was for every thing .
thank you very much .
mr. <unk> , that she made me to give up to the <unk> , who just eat and bad food and <unk> people , and that 's a great thing .
but i 'm doing my best , the same thing that came back to it is , this impressions .
i come out of <unk> farm , and i knew until i was n't mcdonald 's .
and that 's already beginning to be the end , right .
well , yeah .
thank you very much for joining you .
i grew up here in the near near .
and i do n't know if mr. <unk> <unk> that 's because of my time , to ask me if i want to move the lake , and i want to talk about a particular theme .
i was <unk> with my favorite <unk> . i 'm trust .
and i 'm sure motivation is not bad , and i 'm <unk> myself the wife who said , maybe one of them is a sports or another one .
i 'll be a full of a magician .
so today , i 'm going to get a lot of good for the rain to go now , but i have to get tomorrow to do , because i 'm going to train in a three weeks at the <unk> brothers , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a bike -- that 's <unk> miles .
i would have a quick time to the rain doing the training .
so who 's going to have one morning , <unk> , goes on , i merely love to share them .
i 've said , i 've said , well , a little bit , i 'm reading the topic of trust .
and i started to do extra , <unk> , to play .
no worry , the beauty of little <unk> , blind trust , came up with <unk> .
i did n't know what was going on with my mind when i 'm <unk> , how am i going to <unk> the best where i 'm going to do ?
so , i come from from the village with six houses , so , many <unk> , some <unk> and the parent on the courtyard , you have juvenile apples , <unk> and <unk> -- and what do you do .
trust , of course , in sports , of course , in the sports but it 's in me , <unk> and beer .
why would i tell you the story where i 'm from ?
for me , one of the really important stories that i really was looking at the country from the village , and there was a lot of great brothers with the oldest brother who 's the <unk> .
and with the second brother , the same blind way me .
that 's what the point is the light and dark , the way i can only recognize , where <unk> window in the room is that it 's light .
what 's very practical is to the use of the street .
the one , or we can just see if we can see something like that .
you 're not going to wake up , but i do n't say , `` i ca n't tell you , '' is <unk> <unk> .
and the topic of the old men , the other people .
and then again , it 's all over time .
and what i 'm always happening for me is , of course , the fact that you trust , and you can see this huge trust , the <unk> that we all need , as a little <unk> situation , i 'll tell you .
and that was my parents , and they 're like many of them , and i had n't known a blind blind .
we were so the first time that 's been quite a few of life in your life .
and then they had to do that .
and , i 'm saying , it 's a great lucky that my parents had to stand up with us , and he 's on the hand , and then you 're going to talk to you , and then , you know , there 's a <unk> you , and then you can feel <unk> , and then you can see where you <unk> .
a thing that was uncomfortable , we have <unk> this .
and b is our parents from beginning to us to go to us , and then we 're also the <unk> .
so , in the house on the house , the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , it also shifted .
and the blind brothers , he <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> fake .
the <unk> i have , i have to do that up to today .
so this is the big brothers -- these are not just good for the sex and for the same brothers .
and our brothers and my brothers and i , we 're moving on the yard yard , what could all of these things that could do , especially , for example , a bike .
and that 's the <unk> brother with enthusiasm , with the three years , and then we wanted to -- michael and me .
and then , starting with <unk> , like , many of these little kids , in the previous children 's running <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and then the <unk> can be done .
but we do this with <unk> , at some point .
and then the big question : how does it look at it ?
and how do you get that trust , the trust trust , the children 's and the children of the staff will fall away from the bicycle and <unk> and the other hand , we do n't have to be able to go to this .
and our solution was that we have a lot of our parents , where are the <unk> , so where we 're in the car , where <unk> bites , where , maybe , maybe , some <unk> stuff , <unk> -- that 's not even more thoughtful stuff , <unk> -- the ai n't do n't get away -- because we knew that they are .
and we had to have ourselves between ourselves , but we have to hear the other part of the other .
and you can not test this , because otherwise it 's going to be so loud that they have n't there more .
but <unk> ' evening , if you turn light up and you can get your bedroom or you want to go to your bedroom or you can see them .
you can try and try to make yourself <unk> <unk> , the tongue , and you 'll notice that the way that people are in the same way , you 'll hear the resistance .
so as bats as the bats are going to hear that , you know , now , <unk> , <unk> resistance , <unk> resistance because the sound are going to be different .
and that 's for me in trust , so trust it in the motion , always have been important .
but <unk> at the high level of security studies , and the security : i have a chance to help me some piece of play .
and i 'm just making a great difficulty and clear , even a lot of accidents that one or another one , of course .
but what i do n't know today today is that i 'm very <unk> , from one of our most successful children .
and one of the land on the mountain is on the site of the higher building on the site .
i wrote , the commitment to also evolve is a <unk> diversity .
and my favorite page is because i 'm a human being , who also came to a human , who also came up with faith , and in the <unk> with trust , i never have as attentive as i have experienced it myself .
but i 'm never going to read this in a way of that .
but it 's also true to do with that , of course , that 's not everybody 's going to experience the exact same thing .
diversity is the brain of our strengths with the <unk> , to know , where am i good , what am i going to take talent and where i am i 'm really a very strong complete myself with my gain ?
and our brother we go back and get home from the house .
so then , okay , we put a <unk> here .
there 's a lot of the window out of the window for example , for example .
and the computer was then she said , michael and i probably ever <unk> with a little kid , and the girl she would say : `` oh , i do n't know .
but the last thing is , who would like to get down ?
so i do n't .
and i think of the other people , we are the generation of young women here , too .
and from that point , i 'm always going to do with it .
and then , it was the consequence that we 're all going to get together three <unk> at the top and the dad with the <unk> <unk> , and no longer knew what he 's supposed to say now .
because of course , of course , of course , the trust is , of course , the other story .
would have the dad said , `` the god 's great , help , help , to help , to help , to help , to help , to the danger that one of us would have been afraid and the danger <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- i do n't know .
but it 's never happened .
he had to be like he had to go to a moment of it , he 's slowly himself , or he 's <unk> , who has to come to us .
and that was what i found myself really amazing that we had this opportunity .
but it 's clear , no worry , this is not rocket , not a necessary to make a later .
for me , the different artistic i ever had to be important in my life , everyone , yeah , yeah .
and all of all , all of that , you know , because i could n't see myself , where did my borders , what my disclosures .
so , i could have heard good samaritan , i would have never .
and i did n't have the <unk> .
and i do n't like to do it , in <unk> .
i go to now , you know , you know , in rain .
now , it 's not at five degrees like this .
and they 're <unk> , but still as it is light .
but i always have to trust this with the trust of trust , that i tried different songs .
and first of the first , for example ,
and that was , for me , because there 's the coach who had in the sciences , said , `` okay , we have a lot of kids kids , but parents ' blind children . ''
actually , it 's good , because you 're going to stick another person on the line .
and then you realize what the other is .
and it was always my tall trust , of course , when i 'm going to make the competition for the competition , it 's hard , because then the other one can do what i do n't <unk> .
so , there 's a method that you can do , and that 's what you trust .
the other hand is a foot in the <unk> , and i leave you to go out and look backwards , the beating head , and then it 's back in the back back up , and the competition is over , because there 's the full content .
i 'm not trying to do it here .
i still had a lot of it .
i mean , this is risky stuff right now .
and i do n't have a lot of a lot of a volunteers , right ?
so , preaching .
sound , i 'm <unk> .
okay .
the next thing to me was a sports in the high school and just <unk> .
my parents were home or so to today , and that 's what they teach for children .
but for me , in school , i could be really sure , how do i move myself to school to get my <unk> energy ?
and then i 'd like one possibility in school in school .
and even though i actually thought , this is all such as good as it 's boring , because <unk> is something that is more like for the most playful , i am .
i did n't know , `` i used to do that -- i did n't know anymore .
i would say , well , i 'm going to do it with the <unk> .
and then , what 's happening is , you know , human beings , again , that 's the big diversity here in the sport , because you need it to be a force , you need good missions and it <unk> <unk> .
now , you 've got some of your work in a way of your work ?
it 's also in the fueling business .
you 're just going to be fast when you 're just a full of trust in your technology .
if you trust that trust , the force you 're in every possible , the bad weather , the soft weather , the soft snow , you can get the <unk> , and you can get the force to the <unk> , and you can get the force to the <unk> .
and if you have to trust , and you can trust it in the team .
because as a <unk> , which is nothing , i 've been <unk> <unk> .
and i 've never seen something like today -- i have to use the word -- my <unk> -- -- because my favorite -- has made my practice .
but nothing , we do n't think again .
now , i 'll just get you to the time , maybe i 'll just wait .
take one , one of them still came up with another kind of thing .
what i 'm always doing is i 'm always using the subject of physics , which is the practice that i 'm going to just imagine the audience , like it is , if you do n't see nothing like this , and you 're <unk> <unk> .
and when you <unk> <unk> , you 've got two sticks in the hand .
so , of course , i do n't have any hand on , you could n't , i could take my finger and feel the <unk> .
it 's not .
so i have to help me different .
i 've been doing my favorite <unk> , which is walking on me .
and the thing that makes me the same thing with the voice .
so , the need to do is <unk> the same thing .
and that 's what 's important for trust .
the precision in communication , so in the '50s economy .
and the soprano answer is always <unk> , when it comes to the <unk> , who says me and <unk> , who says , left on 11 , then i know it 's easy to the left , so i 'm going to go gently to the left , so i 'm going to go gently to the left , so i 'm going to go gently to the left , so i know it 's easy to the left , so i 'm going to go gently to the left , so i know it 's easy to the left , so i 'm going to go gently to the left
when he says , left to ten bit , little <unk> , and when he says , right on 10 .
okay , anybody all the time ?
then , <unk> problem , because then i have to stand up or you must be able to get it , i know , i know , i know , i know , i know , i know , i know , i know , i know , i know , i know , i know , i know , i know , i know , i know , i know ,
and for me , it 's really big , critical when the <unk> walks before , i have to say me to really give a really completely <unk> to say .
in fact , it 's for me to say , it 's for me to be the tools that it enables me to me , but it 's very quickly as others that are starting in the same competition .
and i can just do that if i 'm doing it with both arms to me , i 'm going to stand on a leg , and i really have to do the eyes of your eyes -- ha ha -- or the way it 's open , it does n't get you to open .
then you have to put it up and you have to be on the other leg and they 're going to stand and get to be little happy , but you have to stand to be quiet .
also with high shoes .
yes , and that 's what i 'm really interested in the very important thing when i 'm in a book of time , like `` how do i look at the guy , i want to say , `` i have to do the right hand , because i 'm really sure men , because i have to make the right <unk> because i 'm sure that i think it 's .
so this does n't know what he 's going to tell me .
so i 'm the one that requires him to open the way to communication .
and that 's like joining every <unk> .
if someone knows my needs , he ca n't help me , but i 'm just asked , and i have to say , well , i 'm going to have to be <unk> by the curve , you know , the point might be used to be <unk> .
or i 'm preparing for you , as now as i 'm looking at the street , you know , as long as the long time the mountain is because if we first leave the <unk> , you think , well , you think , now , you know , now , it 's got to be over .
and just just like the sound of <unk> and the thing simply do n't stop .
and there 's a lot of times that i 've had the pilot , like it 's lying in the ground , which is what i think about , maybe only two minutes , about the pilot , we might have -- so you still have to be on the way to get off .
so , of course , that 's what important is to have been the exact same thing to have the <unk> .
i 'm listening to the <unk> -- here 's what else else that have been <unk> ?
who 's more ?
so my best time , however , already , but it was in september , and now in april , i never told a honestly ever ever , like <unk> .
and the <unk> moment is a moment of the moment .
and for me , like i said , this is the exact extension of only possible when i just open my ears open .
the other thing that i 'm trying to explain is what he sees about , and i think that 's the possibility to get perfect .
and that 's one of the really important things i say : trust is more training and not this <unk> <unk> .
so , you know , `` stop , '' as a blind , '' not so much , frankly , the <unk> .
because i had the experience that i had a <unk> on a <unk> right and left wrong .
and then this was what it was in the competition at the competition , because it was next to the way down to the way down next feet .
and i 'm half the three meters in the three days .
so , as i said , that was -- of course , it was -- of course ,
i do n't know that because the <unk> have got to turn around , so <unk> <unk> .
and i happen to me today , people , to say , on the left , and then , you know , `` the other ones , the other ones .
so then , then , then , then , it was , unfortunately .
power versus life is not so much .
but it 's clear , in <unk> situation with pressure , that you probably know all of the work , or the university of times you need to go .
and of course , of course , we often challenge , is a <unk> , but of course , it 's really a lot of hard challenge .
but for me , as i said , `` self-confidence , '' mainly , i have to know the risks .
and i have to say , i 'm as somebody who does n't see , is quite big in the advantage of that , because i 'm saving my risk in many ways .
so , as the <unk> , i 'm so much everybody .
from driving <unk> tree from the fall , the slope of the fall , the ones i know , and i 'm sure , and that 's the important -- i 'm also doing good pages .
but that 's also being able to trust , if you do n't trust it .
and if you found a few percent , the only way that i need it .
and with that , i think , well , the same thing , as well .
because that 's what i 'm doing is , in some sense , is what i 'm doing is really really critical .
you need the same end and i have to be clear , what does it mean , trust it ?
because the thing often is <unk> faster , it 's used to use .
i trust that or the or me .
but the thing is really important is that it 's too much more .
it 's that you 're supposed to be a lot of <unk> .
and that 's why you 're too -- because we 're going to keep people with <unk> <unk> <unk> , we want to see a <unk> sense of it .
and the point that it 's very often is that we can also create the long-term target .
that we can do it -- in my case , for example , weeks , i went to the <unk> .
and then i 'm exactly like that , i have to look for a moment , which i can trust , or i 'm going to look at that , i 'm going to go to the top .
and how do you do the person that you 're in the end of the mountain , and you 're also in the top ?
well , i mean , i had the most incredible benefit , i do n't know , if it was to give me a hundred meters next to me .
and then i was quite <unk> .
it can be the advantage , then , really , really , is n't a problem .
and i also had the crux of the art work , now regardless of the <unk> bin , i <unk> and myself , i did n't have <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> .
this is already <unk> , if you 're going on , and you hear the car you hear , you have n't even see much , you have n't even see a lot to know where you 're going to hurt , and you can actually learn it , it hurts , if i exit .
and these things are always interesting for me .
now , to have the sophistication , but to know , hey , i 'm going to be a war , but i think so i want to focus on the way , so it 's also a new new experience .
and just the <unk> <unk> thing is little while <unk> , because in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , it 's like , you 're just going to go to a day , and it 's just a lot of a lot of separation .
you go and go and go away , and it 's still moving away , and you 're still getting less plants .
you take the <unk> <unk> , <unk> gun , <unk> gun from before the first <unk> <unk> ,
so when you look at declassified , the list of the last one , the <unk> .
and so then the only thing then , then , that 's what we 're doing .
we just looked at the world 's distance or the other .
so i 'm there , i trust <unk> 's major trust in the entrance , despite his strange <unk> , who had his hand .
because i thought , `` well , as i would probably say , '' i 'll probably get faster than that the thing .
but as i said , it 's pretty much more elegant , because you do n't think about yourself a lot of change now .
and right , right , it 's what it gets to do when it 's going to be difficult .
so if you put it into the height and the air force .
or if it 's next to a <unk> , when you put <unk> little open , where it 's left and the right .
and then it becomes a particularly good , and if there is still night and everybody with <unk> <unk> , then , when you 're not told , and then he would have said me to the pitch , he really would have a really really good in the handle .
because i was being <unk> as a single without <unk> , and that was what it was .
trust , we created this , and i was able to say , well , i can , of course , my favorite , my girlfriend , a hundred percent trust , i 'm going to do that , and we had a good job of that .
but i also have a <unk> , even as the prospect i 'm going to focus on the mountain , you 're on the right on the right , the right on the right , the one on the right on the right , left rock , left to 11 .
you 'll be standing on , and all of that .
so for us , we trust , we 're looking for <unk> , so we put a rope on your backpack , and i had to go back to the potter floor .
in the other hand , <unk> <unk> , i <unk> that i was also the height of the stairs .
and she 's just a while that 's <unk> <unk> , or he 's <unk> <unk> , and she 's got <unk> <unk> , and that i did n't know what to look at what was going on and i had n't gotten on just a way .
and what i really showed is that the whole thing that 's actually showing , how beautiful it is , when you 're clear that up on the top of the very , you just have a lot of that sort of thing to do it , but it 's like the <unk> effect , with the <unk> brothers .
but the other thing that i 've noticed is that trust that i 'm going to have to do it , and when i really have a really forgotten to the top of the top .
but that 's also with others , the <unk> , the way trust , how trust it works .
when we 're in the mountain night , we were mostly in the group of it , and we were in the other day , and we were all seven people behind us and the other thing that we had to have been looking at , and that was a different behind us and i was already saying , `` please , why do n't anybody have been looking behind us ?
nighttime , you ca n't look at the church of the back .
that 's kind of no reason .
and then i realized , `` oh , yeah , yeah , sure you have trust your trust in their skills , and at some point , it 's pretty <unk> .
you go to the dark , you 're going to go to 12 o'clock in the blue , you 're not light .
this is totally designed when you 're <unk> , the air will be thin , so , really , still , and now , still have a <unk> , and now , there 's no more <unk> .
and then , at some point , the moment that 's said , yes , the only person was totally practical , behind you , because the friend of me are doing this , and we were constantly doing the same thing -- the way women do so .
and all night , the night , we have told us something and the other in the group , and the other thing in the group had just been this <unk> , <unk> , ok , it 's just a <unk> 's now , and it 's only <unk> of his hour , which has told me .
or i 've got her what else , and you know , i was n't going to tell you about the mountain .
and just to know that , it 's anybody who might be really bad at this , maybe we 'll have talked about it -- it 's still <unk> hour , the sun 's coming in .
and these things , this stuff can also increase its way from the outside , and it can be a little bit of physical , and it can be a little bit of what it can be , you can get your personal and reached .
and for me , trust is , it 's a perfect , and when it 's as personal and the ones that you want to do , then some of the things that 's right there .
that 's basically clear , in sports with the gold that you <unk> -- do n't i know why the problem is , maybe , i do n't know why the value is , or to look at it , is n't it a lead ?
so i 'm doing that with some of the things that some of the things , in vancouver , six hundred times is extremely difficult to do that .
if all of this is real gold , i do n't do it here , i would be on the <unk> , i 'll see it .
or at least , in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
but i said , `` what i 'm going to do is more , that you can imagine , what have i actually been , '' and how i 'm really creating my skills and making things that are focused on a period .
like i , i have to do my skills , but of course , in the team that we all need to do , whether in the training , in the course , in the course of the day .
anyway , if the age of old man or young woman , we need people to trust , too .
and when we then have this goal in mind , and it 's the best proof that we can trust in our lives .
and if you can even have it , you can also be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to scale it in other areas .
thank you very much .
now , a science for me , that 's title of my talks , the building is to <unk> your beautiful maps .
what i 'm driving is the very keen that are the very <unk> of the sciences again , and the sciences again as a slightly more idyllic in general population .
i could basically be satisfied .
when i <unk> a <unk> <unk> , there 's all the time with `` compelling literature '' '' is the <unk> <unk> .
even every single browser has a range of <unk> <unk> newspapers , magazines , <unk> , where scientific issues , <unk> issues , somehow understandable .
and every one of the tv station has a <unk> , where somehow scientific stuff .
even , this is totally <unk> , when you look at what 's going on , and you have to have a lot of things with scientific issues .
every program has somehow got a own compared in the <unk> , but yet it 's such a pure <unk> story .
science is one thing i can look like , i can love to read , but i 'm not like that , but i 'm not interested in the way .
cool , well , is really just in terms of self-awareness , with low bad , somewhere , there 's the bad , right ?
in countless , for example , a 30 minutes , at least nothing to do with reality , but that 's cool , <unk> ?
and i can identify myself .
big bang , because i can laugh on it , i do n't understand the jokes , but it 's great .
that 's extremely bad .
because , that 's kind of an beauty that we can only do with such technology and things we can do with the technology .
but at the same time , it did n't get off to the end of themselves .
i 've got some examples of how science or science just so a <unk> .
so , a very cool example of london , you 've got a nice tower , <unk> , the architect , even not as it 's as a result , and we 're going to sort of <unk> it .
what happens is now that the sun is coming from the top of the top in this facade , and i 've been looking at that , <unk> , and then somewhere else in the other hand at a point .
and that was big through the press , and that 's where there 's been a seat .
bad , the heat , has <unk> so dramatically the <unk> , the really long , long , long ago , because there 's the <unk> .
and you ask , you know , this architect like a architect , not actually , just as a little bit of physics , because i mean , it 's totally new to cool stuff .
so what i found is , of course , is <unk> , somehow , sort of a <unk> , where he would have missiles with radiation a flexible .
so , i really wonder what 's going to be more design or architect or where did he have studied ?
now this is a very frustrating example .
one of the most interesting things have these current issues of current things , is also the same thing .
the technologies , that 's been a few years ago , when it came to the media .
and that was the move , because , <unk> , the <unk> , the one , in one point , a danger .
the genes was in a place with green <unk> .
genes were kind of a bit of literal .
<unk> , oh , there are genes inside .
there was moments where the market farmers have actually gotten , `` hey , i have <unk> vegetables .
no idea what this is supposed to be .
so , okay , so , <unk> <unk> , can we have a discussion .
but at the time i was involved in the lab , i was totally involved in the lab , and i totally realized totally ago because i tried to have these evil genes in my bacteria , these <unk> <unk> .
and was totally frustrated , came home , and my fellow neighbor : `` aah , you ai n't happy , what 's going on ?
i mean , yeah , i 've been able to transform a little gene in my bacteria , and that does n't work .
that was what i tried to explain to explain , so somehow a <unk> , the genes , i thought , yes , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think
that was what i was really meant , so this particular sequence i wanted to put in this <unk> .
but that was what the woman actually has .
i never have the same hand again .
who knows what i 'm wearing is nuts ?
genes is what makes a very bad thing .
this is now a decade now , it 's been happening , and yet it has somehow been doing this in consciousness .
genes , that 's what makes matter .
<unk> , i 've read about it , right ?
it 's getting the gene and the gene , but it 's really in our language .
<unk> is bound to europe , was a headline .
and it contains considerably of other corn that 's not the genes .
one other headline , <unk> <unk> , they have given rats in rats .
yes , that was a beautiful slogan .
but they 're not that old and it 's also not , in which level i 'm going to be concerned about .
anyway , whether the time or the image , all of us talk about <unk> .
luckily , it 's not <unk> in the <unk> , but i 'm afraid that 's not a long time .
but that 's just what uncertainty in the population is because they 're just not interested in the themes .
and we have to think of our future , we have to employ these technologies .
now , <unk> <unk> , none of the big on the topic , but it 's about the big , but it 's about the most common thing .
and that 's pretty sad .
so how does this happen , is this information from the lab in the population ?
if we think of this little boy , some of our scientist is happening in his lab , an experiment , some of the time , and good , and he thinks that it 's time , and it 's going to be , you know , that 's what it 's the public .
and then you have to go to the first professor .
the head decides that you 're going to , ok , cool piece of , <unk> , <unk> , the name on it , and that 's always important in science , <unk> .
good idea , i 'm still not in public , it 's about a <unk> .
yes , the <unk> sense , oh , great idea , the class , because we do a <unk> rebel .
<unk> , there 's a <unk> , a beautiful idea , and that 's kind of made out of the shoreline .
so that 's what will <unk> , yes , but who are really ?
now these days are barely alone , they have several <unk> <unk> , they 're going to have a common <unk> , a common <unk> .
and from all these things , the ones that really cool cool projects , will then be about the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , no matter , <unk> or <unk> .
that 's the way .
from the base , it 's always going to go on the shoreline , in the shoreline , the really cool experiments that really starts , and really , in this occasion , it 's going to show up in this situation .
so , that 's good news magazine , who are really good , is there 's free , yeah , but who are i gon na get to ?
and basically , in the way , that 's what 's happening for it .
in the '50s community , we 're always using the <unk> of the <unk> .
so , the thing that 's true of interest is that the <unk> then , yes , nice and good .
beautiful magazine , the audience who care about , and maybe the most frequently about a idea , where was that in this strange record .
who are i really doing ?
the <unk> , which is the most difficult thing .
well , this is what i 'm doing is now that the word district , i 've tried to think it 's great <unk> , who made the circumstances of the circumstances i 've tried to do it .
still , again , we 'll just have somehow to actually get our future , if we 're dealing with these <unk> experiences .
fracking , <unk> , renewables , renewables , that are all things that are <unk> , who 's really understanding and you can not get to the way .
my project , my idea is , is different from the <unk> , that little young , many scientists out of the boat , really completely from his regular <unk> , and he gives a course of a course , a seminar , how to do science .
so , what happens most of the time happen , so a scientist , i have a buddy , and we had a <unk> , we 've been told for a good 20 years , it 's <unk> , it 's a <unk> rule to his profession .
once he tells his mouth and talk about his profession , he has <unk> us .
so , like , the scientists , they 're scientists , they 're telling you what 's going on .
<unk> , hear it 's , like , <unk> , but it 's almost as same as genes .
there 's a private degree , oh , oh , you do n't know what 's behind .
so , really , to teach , that 's nice and good , if you 're on a meeting and you 're on your people , your <unk> , your <unk> , your <unk> , your <unk> , your <unk> , your <unk> , your <unk> , your <unk> , your <unk> , you can talk about <unk> , but still , you know , you can tell you about the water .
where is the problem , it really stops and ordinary ?
i was high , that 's my idea , these young scientists , who are n't that far more malleable to school , who i was going to say .
this has a benefit , <unk> , like investors , who want to know what 's happening in the <unk> .
and finally , the <unk> that is used to be used , so that 's actually going to communicate the climate language .
but the training of those training , that 's just one story .
i want to make you a quick record , and you want to give your project , you project a jury , triumph , <unk> , honest , worse , it 's not .
there 's a quote i do n't know if the real thing is , of albert einstein , if you ca n't explain , you did n't really understand it .
so , scientists of the laboratory and your project really has to rethink , how can i communicate this really normal way ?
so , there 's a lot of us .
<unk> are totally modern , everywhere , in every university , the same , but also , i 'll just get the <unk> .
who 's driving the city in university of any , does a talk to me from a talk ?
these are the ones who are looking at it .
and i 'm back again .
so , these are the people who are looking at the same thing , and you 're very <unk> with you .
that 's beautiful , because some of the things are made , everybody is happy , everybody 's happy , and that 's it .
so i 'm announcing on a second point , and say , it 's not in this cartoon project .
and these scientists are still even more likely to get , how do they have kids ?
because many of the things have actually been to reduce the difference in the world .
because scientists , like the research , and how children are exploring their world , is the same .
children are really quite interested at work very quickly .
they 're doing something like this .
you 're all saying what works ?
<unk> , fall fall , it does n't work , the next repetition , i change a few parameters , i think it 's new .
children learn extremely <unk> .
these are really <unk> , and <unk> and the <unk> , i 'm suggesting what happens to the factors that i think is that it works or not .
that 's normal !
but that 's a lot of people .
and from that , i think , really , really , is that it can be , when after that , the <unk> process , and these scientists permanently in the neighborhood , in the environment with the children of the kindergarten , from the schools , in the environment , with the kids from kindergarten , from the schools , in the environment , in the environment , with the kids , in the middle of the marriages , from the schools , in the environment , in the environment , with the kids , the children , in common , in common , the children 's kids , and the scientists are actually in basically , basically , basically , basically , basically , basically , basically , basically , basically , basically , basically , basically , basically , basically , basically , basically , basically , basically , basically , basically , basically , basically , basically , basically ,
and then you can , maybe somewhere , this is such my hope , tell the kids that you have to do , and then i 'm also cute , and my favorite <unk> , which then , for scientific issues , because the children told him this .
that 's not somewhere in the newspaper , that 's not somewhere in galileo , but his kids tell him something that has <unk> the <unk> , and then you can see and shake your head as a architect like this house .
and not only i 'm doing some great <unk> , but also the <unk> .
that 's my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately , it 's just to have the first <unk> that i call painted , yes , that 's , <unk> for our scientists , that 's just not subject , that 's just a different priorities .
a scientist do n't have to communicate .
yes , i think , okay , okay , i 'll call the next .
but who somehow works in a center , <unk> is in a company , like , you 'll have the next moment .
thank you very much .
i 'm assuming , is the question .
now , you can fly every day .
the last weeks was awful .
weather has made us a big position to make it through the calculation .
seven years ago , i was asked to ask if i want to take it to take it .
i was a <unk> , almost 10 years , in munich <unk> , in munich and in <unk> .
we 've come up to the top .
had <unk> than a customer .
and for me , that was actually more , well , that 's <unk> .
so what should this happen ?
<unk> , that 's ridiculous .
but i 've learned that , you know , i 've learned that behind it , and i 'm here today .
and yeah , it 's a little bit crazy , but it 's also a very hard place to be very emotional .
it 's beautiful and it 's exciting and it 's exciting .
and i 'm just going to just go to the next few years , <unk> minutes a little bit from this life of a <unk> .
i 'm an indian <unk> .
the company is that a hundred and a <unk> , a hundred and <unk> .
i 'm the egyptian of the <unk> .
this company has been around for 20 years .
and the ceo of the <unk> .
the company is that there was about <unk> or <unk> .
the battery the zeppelin hits the zeppelin here .
seven .
this is a picture i want to show you the little point , which is , it 's a red , so you 're not going to be a cartoon , but it 's not a thing that 's going to be too big .
there 's only world 's <unk> area .
and it 's actually only a decade of active .
that 's what it looks like .
there are about 20 thousand active wide active world .
so this is no market .
that 's not even a unique place .
this is a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is , why do you actually do that ?
so , how do we do it ?
<unk> in the war and the only 10 , because we can talk about why this is .
and very quickly .
<unk> is a bunch of a number of crazy <unk> <unk> .
all of a few of a time .
it 's got to be <unk> to <unk> <unk> in the first world war in the world war ii .
then in the first world , <unk> <unk> , by the way , the <unk> and <unk> , were <unk> <unk> .
and then they were going to have london and so on and so forth .
and when we came up and eight to london , and then you 've got a big campaign to fly out , the english newspapers was <unk> with the christian slogan : that , you can get it , but not with bombs , but in a sense of an eye intention .
so the story has been in <unk> .
and we had a zero campaign .
but <unk> , the customer , was n't so much so cool , because he had suddenly realized what the memory memory was put on it .
and you know , that was a little bit for the convenience of the pollination .
but anyway , it was a good app in london , except the weather in the north , so many years ago , a very bad and very <unk> .
and we 're not quite moved .
then , <unk> 20 , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it has a <unk> , or the <unk> , that it was going to go to america .
this has felt a myth that the whole german nation has felt something when he was <unk> and <unk> that the computer was .
it was being in new york with <unk> units .
and the whole german nation is <unk> , we 're again who are again .
this is in all its dna in all the same way in all its cell experience in all the same area of this , and that 's what it explains is that it explains a little bit of this myth from this device .
but actually , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , to be <unk> and <unk> only five , six , seven , seven <unk> were still built , and only two is big , the <unk> and the ones who have the passengers .
burnham , a hundred , where about <unk> passengers and <unk> , it was <unk> at the end .
but it was a myth .
and the <unk> then , the first stage was <unk> , the first live crash , but it 's also worse .
next to the titanic , where a icon , a product is a product and then never again .
and the other vehicles also hired .
and <unk> , <unk> the last few <unk> destroyed .
the materials used to <unk> , <unk> , that indoor antarctica .
it was n't about <unk> years .
and then the <unk> <unk> had <unk> <unk> and <unk> that they had , maybe one thing should start again .
and i was hired <unk> because they have a great product , because they have a great product , we 'll get a look at it , but the market .
so , yes , is he at all a marketplace ?
so what is there ?
that 's like that .
we 're talking about now .
the slope of the <unk> , that 's probably just a little bit , we 're still going to be , you know , guys , guys , have done a lot .
there are many companies that were built out of this mountain program .
it 's now <unk> employee , around 20 billion .
that 's a real demographic , high of oil .
there 's a lot of this .
and i believe that i believe , and i believe , you know , there 's a point of coming here .
the zeppelin in itself is a very ordinary plane like any other plane , but it has , but she <unk> a gas , no hydrogen , and also a <unk> .
it 's like a whale , it 's on and under the same way , and there 's a lot of the <unk> .
the time is now not to explain that in detail .
in the inside , a weather looks like , and you can see a structure like this .
there 's two main types of <unk> .
there are certain <unk> , which is what we 're <unk> in the fall and the <unk> .
they do n't have structure in the structure , and they 're like <unk> in <unk> .
these are most of the educational games that have been built in the world , about shark , a piece of piece .
and there 's only one today as i said earlier , only <unk> on the war , minus our own existence , so maybe 20 .
and then the production of it is , when a skin is placed .
the same thing is one more time .
and the skin banks is also a <unk> .
come from the <unk> .
tr : the <unk> of the astronauts .
<unk> then there are the origins .
costs one more point two million dollars such a shell .
and it has to be <unk> , have to be <unk> , and it has to be <unk> , because always you can look at it , that if you were an exit in a house or a hole that no longer can .
and you can do that , the <unk> again , and look at exactly whether it 's controlled to the light .
and at the end , a <unk> is a <unk> that is the only way it 's here .
so the zeppelin is technically .
and this is where you see here at the bottom of the numbers , very quickly .
one point nine percent , one point nine percent , one point of nine percent <unk> , which means that the thousands of thousand officials wrote about a thousand thousand miles in the year , perhaps perhaps <unk> .
that 's very little and very good .
this is a <unk> .
so that can be looking at .
but there 's another trend that we really care about , and we 're going to show up here .
we had three years ago , when i started to start with <unk> five , eight years ago , <unk> percent <unk> , and last year , <unk> percent <unk> .
and this year , we were at <unk> percent .
if you want eight years , my eight years , at some <unk> and <unk> , you can say , at least in this eight , of course , a <unk> of the <unk> , the weather has changed for us .
we 're <unk> .
we ca n't fly through frozen signals .
you want to see something .
and the <unk> or <unk> , is actually a year 's construction .
so a little image of that , our weather is not only only , but also statistically , because we do weather in weather .
but because this is , now , it 's the european union , the european union , it 's a program in a program , almost ten million dollars , and we 're a natural part of this program .
i 'm now from finland today .
and this is the common thing that 's on here is a flying lab .
<unk> is called the campaign .
and we 're <unk> <unk> in the <unk> between the surface and <unk> .
that 's called the <unk> <unk> .
and the zeppelin t , from italy to <unk> <unk> , to finland in a <unk> .
many of many of many hundred of the world 's measuring that it 's the air , and the air is how they respond to our things that we 're on the ground .
and so , i 'm looking at that , there 's the top , there 's just a second way of doing the second .
a great commission .
and it 's as a result , if you want to be a <unk> of the subject .
so this is very good .
and here 's a couple of <unk> .
that 's the puzzle over a year or a half week week .
and in finland , the weather is great , <unk> degrees , 30 degrees .
the <unk> people say this was never .
i was just doing wonderful , beautiful <unk> days .
and the mosquitos were not so bad .
we were also in africa .
and for de dollars , more than <unk> <unk> , they were able to look at the <unk> , the burning are over <unk> by millions .
but you can also ask , this is all africa , that 's a little bit like you ask for meaning , looking for a idea , after a question , it 's good when you 're in the cinema in the summertime that 's happened in the cinema at the movies of the movies , the movie is going to be a roll or a stranger , it 's gone to the film or not the name of the movies .
so i asked myself , well , what do we do ?
and what do we do that ?
and at the end , we were done after two years .
the <unk> then did n't go on .
the whole family came in and the project was finished .
and a tornado has <unk> , the <unk> of the royal then were so broken as the broken that could stay in the corner .
but it was n't so bad .
we had a good insurance and then were really happy .
that was the prototype .
and i did n't know what to do with it .
yes , what we 're doing today , a very quick <unk> from the <unk> .
what we 're doing today is that it 's just about complexity , it 's about questions , growth or ineffective .
what we 're doing today is the <unk> here in <unk> .
we 're going to do the course .
we have to keep the zeppelin .
<unk> is the aging .
there are still a little operating way , after 10 , nine times of being attacked .
we 're just replacing the whole genome problem for almost five million dollars .
so , there 's something that we 're talking about , and we 're talking about it .
we 're going to make the <unk> people all .
we are a <unk> <unk> , who 's been controlled by the german <unk> and the european organization , and the way that the <unk> of the <unk> are controlled with , and as a result , as it is like <unk> , or how to exploding it .
that 's also <unk> and costs money , and it has to be getting together .
the question is , do you continue ?
would you be more on ?
do you get bigger <unk> ?
there 's <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
so what do you do ?
do you go on the market ?
do you go on the phone ?
and that 's what we 've been looking at in my time .
and we have some <unk> hatch .
and by the way , the <unk> of some <unk> of <unk> , and was <unk> .
at the beginning of the car , the <unk> , the <unk> .
the citizens the german population has saved him with six million subscribers than a donation , when the fourth was <unk> and he was drinking , he did n't have a donation a donation .
and it 's at all the <unk> <unk> and the other companies , and we were able to do or magpie , and there 's other companies that were n't there .
we were in tokyo , <unk> .
we were , and they 're hearing the past , in san francisco with a customer .
there was a very uplifting tool .
both of them are sadly .
so , too , too , too , too .
at the same time , we won <unk> .
and i did n't have a picture because we can not show the <unk> <unk> .
but in america , now , in america , the <unk> of the first <unk> are in the finished .
we have sold three pieces .
with <unk> , we undertake a partner that 's also a partner with a partner that 's a partner for a partner .
and that 's a big deal , but at the same time , in the same time , in fact ,
two customers are basically <unk> because it was n't .
why did n't it ?
we actually know it already .
either , the location was not the right or the passengers to go to the speed of the passengers , or in america , you know , the last 30 century , the advertising did .
these are people who have <unk> , have seen this with the field , they said , `` <unk> , '' again , again , again , a <unk> , who makes an <unk> .
there 's no way to do that you can be there .
and it was actually twice so much difficult to get in marketing , `` hey , guys , '' and he 's coming .
<unk> is good .
the pilot put in the year , transport , demographic <unk> , <unk> passengers .
but last year , we 've only been <unk> about weather .
there 's a couple of a million .
that 's bad .
the zeppelin 's <unk> <unk> <unk> .
it 's the sense of , of course , if i look at the boat , you know , the passengers the passengers and you 're not going to do not to do pitches because it 's mouth to mouth , and the people say that 's nice , and it 's really nice , and it 's going to keep on your friends , and you know , well , you know , that 's nice , and it 's going to be more and more in the family .
and we 're great .
and i still have to add into the mistake that we think we 're <unk> .
you could still get more and more active .
we have a <unk> on the <unk> and we 're <unk> .
and that 's not true .
we also do advertising .
that 's a problem that has been cutting off .
and what it did is that this has done with the island of <unk> .
but the <unk> is a difficult market .
and you have to ask the same problem , do n't make sense ?
we actually have enough marketing ads , but internet has a lot of changes , which was <unk> across the next because the <unk> changes everything .
the <unk> is largely <unk> , which is why there 's only 10 to the toxic acoustic cities in the world today .
we have three here .
two active , one , the <unk> , the three laptop emitted , 10 times are active .
so , six of 10 .
that means we 're going to be the marketplace , but if it 's at least one , you know .
and hope to come back to a future .
and what at the end david scott , commander of apollo ii , after his <unk> paris and five , he said , `` well , the walk on the top of what 's wrong .
so , good news is beautiful .
we 're doing some of advertising doing that .
we do n't find any customers .
so , let 's find out of the way , we can find a technological value .
we have customer .
that 's not uncommon .
it 's <unk> , it 's on and off .
this is a $ 100 dollar system to get that one .
and then there 's a two-year years .
there 's a curious effect that are very difficult for and <unk> .
so , in any case , this is the situation , <unk> , a point in the world , so it 's not a market .
but we 're going to keep on .
it 's a icon of the region .
the <unk> have the power to do it .
and you 're just asking the question : where are we going to continue it ?
how much money do we spend in the world ?
what do we do for here ?
what is the world 's going on ?
and i personally , you 've asked me to say something personal , i 'm , of course , next to my fellow <unk> , where i wanted to <unk> the <unk> , where i wanted to <unk> the <unk> , the little <unk> dead , you know , it 's actually here today .
i was also a teenager , for greenpeace three years old than i went through studying island and all the <unk> of the jungle , and i had this sort of <unk> that i made it .
and then there was a <unk> talking about greenpeace who are in the money of smallpox and not knowing what they should be , and they were able to be .
and they 're going to employ me to get this all the way .
and i 'm doing three years to do that , and now i 'm doing this in the hope to reach a long future .
zero , right ? neuroscientist seconds , i 'm ready to be ready , thank you .

yes , thank you very much .
these are my three points that i want to talk to the <unk> .
why are we today in the subject or abundance ?
so how do we get to the <unk> ?
and most of all , what ?
what is it that ?
let 's start with our first point .
the first part of it is a little bit .
but it 's also beginning to show the challenges .
a few years ago , this was still a difficult thing to explain that .
that we have a problem today , every child .
that 's what we 're environmental issues .
but it 's always worth it 's happening for it , that 's the challenges that 's the challenges , for example , the population .
all sorts of <unk> species are growing up .
if you look at it in a new long term , the bottom line , for instance , that 's going to be very short episode in history .
we can not imagine that it 's kind of different from the ground as it gets back to it .
you know climate change , the last century years .
some people say , well , we used to have shown in the last century a.d .
you can also see that as well , i can also see that ,
you can also tell you who need ?
you can also tell you the ocean is far away .
but it 's all about if you 're going to be engaged with a bit more specific to avoid things that really is , you know , we just have trouble with the <unk> of health .
<unk> is about 30 degrees .
and there 's degrees of reason in our cities like in vienna or <unk> , in a way , it 's more bad .
but it 's also about the most vulnerable , but especially in asia .
think about the himalayas , where the big streams , and the <unk> of them are constantly getting back out of the himalayas .
it 's not about the planet .
the planet is the most neutral , which we do , there was a lot larger crisis .
and <unk> , but it 's about us to be living in a very hostile life .
it 's about loss of biodiversity .
the deserts of the deserts spreads .
the wax store is going to widen .
that 's the aral sea , where a core part of our cotton came from .
and all of that , where is this ?
all of these bad things , `` i 've got to push you to the global sensory lab together . ''
the one thing we get to get out of earth , what we harvest .
not just that oil and the speed and the <unk> , but also the renewables , the renewables are , but ultimately , it 's the last part of it .
and we 're just supposed to be just going to be able to use this much as we use , to make a few waste waste to produce the same .
so it 's about this in the genesis of the world war already has been used to reduce the whole world 's really dramatically .
that 's the challenge , not just the amount , not just c , not just c , not just c , not just c , not just c , not just c , not just c , not just c , not just a c , a different way to live in a way .
different .
our technology completely spreads .
if we look back at a moment , we look back the hunters and <unk> , and there 's still on the planet societies that are living in the principle , is that , with a more natural economy , a person and a year .
in a <unk> , it 's been in the longest era of human history , three tons tons .
today , it 's <unk> to <unk> .
so , this is the thing that <unk> has this issue of view .
and it 's very , very <unk> distributed .
it 's more than more than more than the earth 's more than the earth .
and in other parts of the world , look at africa , it 's very , much less .
and then comes out , we 're shifting the impacts of us , the air , the air is much better in the last decades of it , that we have the same thing in the world .
and the other parts of the world is still going to be less .
and therefore , the conflicts of that we see , from <unk> , is afghanistan , afghanistan , where you look at the <unk> of the american press , and you see where the raw materials come .
and that 's what 's happening there , and it 's very colorful there , which is , there are lots of resources there , where the world 's population are the world .
so if we want to go to the drawing , we have to take a subject .
so we have to change the ecological boundaries everywhere , the <unk> is all over .
and what we have done in <unk> life is not yet that .
this has been the mahatma gandhi who said he said , the world has enough for everybody , but not for anyone .
and there we are , like , in average , there 's a lot of it in the average of life .
that 's like that .
that was the kind of <unk> .
but i always think you have to understand the needs to understand what to change .
even if i was saying that , it 's worth as if i would say , it 's like that way to live different , which is more of a sense of things .
but it 's still coming from the <unk> of the <unk> , you know , `` i 'm going to say , `` i want to say , ''
so , what is it a picture ?
and we have to realize that we have to be parts of the world , economically , in the amount of life , in standard , in a sense , in the decline , we do n't know , in the national world .
so here 's a pretty good mood , but there are people , and you know , you know , humans are n't as good as well , to deal with this story .
i 've written it .
<unk> and climate change have the same amount .
we 're working too much , and we do too much more .
this is on a page , we 're at stress , and eventually it 's too much .
i also work very well .
and on the other hand , we 're going to do this <unk> .
so what is a good life ?
so how can we define this ?
now comes up with a little bit of scientific media .
and i 've also been talking about , and what i 'm saying by a while i 'm going to say about this is a lot of , but here 's what i can think about , how can i define this way to the point ?
and there 's important to understand that life has always been two aspects .
life has changed the issue of objective , as i 'm going to eat what i have to eat .
did i have a roof over the head ?
i have my friends ?
i can have a relationship , relationship , can i play life ?
but also , how do i go to do with me how to go around with this ?
i do n't know that the normal quality of life .
and then i 'm going to get two terms of the things that are important in the position .
that 's a needs .
the needs is the very fundamental dimension of our human development , our evolution , our feelings of emotions .
if we can satisfy our needs , we 're happy .
and you ca n't tell you , needs sustainable , sustainable , not sustainable .
needs to do n't talk to a <unk> .
what are needs ?
you can quote , `` many scientists , '' i just mentioned two .
and you see , of course , you see , of course , the physical needs , but also need to be guilty , to social relationships .
after protection , after <unk> , after creativity , after all of us , to spirituality , to freedom .
that 's all of the things to do with money .
but not a big part , it 's not , but the question is how i could think about it in my life .
and there i am in the second importance .
the strategies .
the strategy i 'm using is to meet this needs .
and there 's a lot of time that i can do with a high risk or with a low <unk> .
you can need a lot of money , or do n't need money .
strategies are my behavior as i 'm my needs .
that 's what i have to do with my values , with the resources , with the possibilities that i have .
if i have a little money , i try to have to take my needs to satisfy , when i have a lot of money on the car .
it 's all about the <unk> , which is the roof over the roof , and then you 're going to look at the <unk> .
and here 's what it can be about to do with a lot or not <unk> , that can be sustainable and <unk> .
and when we all strategies that i have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to satisfy my needs , then we 're going to talk about a lifestyle .
that 's like that .
that was the kind of scientific <unk> .
and now , what 's we now doing now ?
so what 's this ?
and there 's just a few samples .
of course , that 's what it needs to find itself for itself .
but the evidence of the individual is on a technological way , here 's what i 've talked about today , and also finally , in the end of the political form .
what can we do ?
what can we do ?
what do we do ?
so , where do we want to go ?
the slides of the beginning , they said , the danger is that we 're going to use and heavier to be more resources .
so , last of the quality of life is , it 's going to be more and more and worse , and that 's going to be worse , and that 's going to be beat .
or , if we can do it , if you 're going to go to a different direction , which is less consumption consumption , maybe it 's a higher quality of life that are connected .
there 's one of my favorite devices , maybe you can know some of the time , <unk> , <unk> , this theme , which is more quality of quality of life with fewer <unk> .
and there 's a lot about technology as i can , every single thing we use the computer , the orange juice , how do i make it so ?
so , you can make it a way to make a different way to make the house out of wood , etc .
to create a lot less more likely to produce more efficiently .
my other teachers , <unk> <unk> has this , the <unk> , the <unk> , and there we are , which is now already already already already , because it 's going to look at the way of looking at it .
where are the needs ?
what kind of services can i have ?
and how do i do that with a little more frustrating ?
and it 's not with a little less but with coffee , <unk> , <unk> percent less .
there 's lots of examples that can already be happening .
in vienna , a tower would be built into a tower with 20 <unk> .
with seven <unk> it 's built in <unk> .
so that 's basically made of lumber .
you may have to use it in the past over a century , and then you can do it again , so much less resources in the time , and you 're going to put it in the time , and you 're going to put it on the stage with a fifth of the house , which is the whole time of the house , that 's been a long time .
but it 's also a lot of it in our own , like , how do i really have myself ?
<unk> <unk> has written a great book , <unk> .
where he shows how hard it 's really really designed to get from from from from that 's way of this product .
the <unk> , i want to get myself to make the other hand , and then i 'm going to be in this race .
you have the same reaction that i took you to get you , and i 'll have the new one .
and most of the nicest `` my <unk> , i 'm the <unk> , you know .
when i underwent my department , we wrote a couple of years ago .
and then you have a way to write , to write , you 're saying , you 're going to call you write <unk> .
i write hundreds of emails .
and i can do a lot more .
this is what we have , that 's the growth , we 're coming back to the bottom .
but i did n't really have a time .
i did n't have to do that .
there 's good examples , slow food for example , where i really want to do the urge to the quality and the desire to the auditorium in the foreground .
and with a very small cost of life , you have more quality control .
one of my favorites is <unk> .
there 's a recent time today , you 've got a moment that , in germany , there 's about a <unk> in germany , in the <unk> of foreign things .
you can start to count them .
who was two , three generations of things , had employees , personal .
they were able to manage the process .
we have to do with this .
and as much people come to realize , with these things all the options .
and you need a draft that helps us to create us with these little things .
so , to be interesting , i think , maybe this is a matter of spaceship , this is what i 'm doing , too , do n't have any shots in the ground .
the next example of this is a place where we have .
it 's a real boom .
star , <unk> , <unk> , maybe 20 years ago , 20 years ago , in alternative circles .
in the meantime , they 're used more and more people when they think about more vulnerable .
if you think about <unk> .
coral reefs , working together , the easy thing is to work with , how can you get the things that we 've got to have this beautiful <unk> here , which is still going to be a few hundred years ago , and yet , and then we have a lot of centuries that 's going to be done on the last year .
so , what 's a typical job is just a better way to use .
that 's the last thing that 's a question of justice .
i 've shown you , as a result , that 's what i think , as the image of africa and europe and a better world .
so , as if you can all have these resources , that 's only possible , just if we 're going to use less less .
and that 's not a way that it does n't mean less quality of life because a lot of us have to have a lot of them .
but it 's a major problem of the economy , the company , the products , the services really make the world that we need to create a good life of a lot less resources .
last aspect , this has done something to do with the major politics after growth , <unk> , i think it .
if you read a little bit about the projections , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you 're about oecd , <unk> , now the next week will be back to the bottom .
it means , yes , a crisis is , in my mind , the door , and also , after that , what we 've talked about , and the numbers of what we 've had , and the numbers have been , you know , that 's essentially for all of the countries go forward .
and there 's no reason again , as i was in my youth , from the 1930s , from the 1930s .
and part of the whole thing has been interesting .
one point five percent growth is now much more than eight percent growth in the last year .
and the eight percent is what china has today .
and that 's about the same thing that we were in a hundred years ago .
all of the things that cake is , of course , is eight percent of the <unk> .
that 's still a number of it , it 's all that way we 're going to do well .
but you have to hire it on , which means , no even if we had zero percent growth , that means , in the next year , the next year is that , in the next year , they have exactly as much producing and consume and income like in this year .
we can do so well , and we can work with that .
that 's also not so wrong , because you know that statistics , which is not going to be long for the quality of life together .
the economy grows , but the quality of the quality are in the most intriguing countries that we 're in the state of that .
and by the way , also , also , jobs , and by the way , they 're not possible with no longer , and it 's not that intimately so intimately , like us , and as they 're all siblings .
it 's not just true , and then you have to look at the economics .
and it 's getting over and over and more and more , again , as a matter of time play or next week , i 'm going to start in the trend , a bigger story to this topic .
already <unk> edward <unk> , who <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> that he said , `` the good life , the good economic worlds ever in the good life . ''
that 's what 's happening in all the past is not to create the growth of the federal government , not primarily to create growth , which is not really effective to do with our countries .
for sure , for example , the countries , for china , for india , is that the rest of the rest of the rest is very different .
and that 's happening , and it 's going to be under <unk> , if we 're going to grow there , we 're just in this very high level of the same , we 're good at life and the species of the species .
and it 's also a thing that needs to be politics .
it takes action .
it takes some clues to say the economists .
it does n't just affect the growth , but we really have to look at it and measure and measurable and ask , how do we have to the life of life , is that ?
is the peak ?
after that , our politicians are actually heading .
of course , what is the <unk> ?
so what do you think ?
we need a very literal aspect of the <unk> to the <unk> , and not the work .
who 's particularly the entrepreneur among them , but the employees you know that very good .
so , what kind of power is to control , at least , a colleague paid .
you could do that very differently .
the resources are kind of , and therefore , the resources are being able to reach and not the work .
and you have to all run the last economic sector to create jobs , to secure and secure , health , infrastructure .
that 's what you 're doing , but you have a little bit more hard .
that means that , of course , more or less , on all of the physical dimensions can be built into this way , we can actually engage , we can do the same products , services than consumers , what do we need to do that , how do we need the right products ?
what do we need and what do n't we need ?
the real policy , the national government .
some of the references i did .
and so , of course , the science percent of all the world is still going to be <unk> , how can we stimulate the growth growth ?
but sadly , nobody was doing .
if you look at the projections , if you look at the last 20 years , it 's going to go to the bottom of it .
the policy is not , and the problem is not going to create growth , but that 's the question we 're going to do with the security and that 's why we have a good life of it ?
so , you know , it 's doing it .
you want the ride to the lake .
with heart , brain , hand and the last , and we 're going to need the same kind of thing that we 're going to need .
thank you very much .
i 'm <unk> <unk> .
and i love this city .
and this city has so many stories .
one of them has happened a few hundred years ago .
and it 's starting to do with creative problem-solving .
so , i get to do that , and i get a little later on history .
it 's going to do with the conservation <unk> .
this is the <unk> that 's in the middle of this town , and lots of this town is also a place , and it 's very scalable .
another story .
it was hot in <unk> , nevada .
one man notice , like , in his shoes , it 's really <unk> .
it 's too warm .
he 's europeans , he knows that .
he does a clean times of a knife , and it 's not long in a long way , and it 's in a lot of holes in a lot of holes in the holes .
he gets over the shoe again , and he 's got a new climate in the shoe .
it 's the shoe that 's not born .
and those number that you see here in the <unk> era of the <unk> <unk> today .
a company is <unk> , and it 's four letters .
one or other of you know it .
he has also <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
both of them have a great deal .
so he says , well , <unk> , i 'll take my own business .
<unk> is going to the stock market .
right now , several million employees today , in fact , a thousand employees , in fact , a thousand employees , in the right way today , is in the right place , in fact , a thousand employees in the right now
so , that 's how to do with creative problem-solving .
why not a little bit new , what do n't it ?
and failure may have been the question they would have to have themselves .
if you do n't know the world 's shoes , it 's for what 's a chance ?
and this particular thing has been a lot of times , i 've been doing it with difficult situations .
if something wrong happened , or my collaborator of mine works or technology , or technology , or technology , or technology , or technology , or technology , or technology , or technology , or technology , or technology .
little memory , little memory , <unk> .
what is this a chance ?
and you get from the <unk> to the <unk> .
what the do is to do that , i 'm going to illustrate this one .
and another example was done by the <unk> art , and that 's what the <unk> statements of <unk> .
and the proof of the people can be in and that 's creative , and that prove how to be the creative , and the proof of how creative people can be when it comes to your own insurance .
so i want to show you some examples here .
so these are actually that before the <unk> era , and that 's also a letter .
i 'm going to be the fantastic thing .
my son did n't have a woman .
it 's just <unk> , and it 's the wife through the <unk> .
or i had the whole day of the sunshine and the <unk> , suddenly suddenly started a <unk> in my process , and i could n't see the other car .
what 's it is obvious , or is it ?
the bush .
the <unk> are <unk> .
i have been <unk> , and two times almost died .
you can actually get a <unk> on the last one of the last possible .
the last i was not supposed to be a <unk> .
he was a young woman in the <unk> .
if you 're a man , every one explanation is to shake up .
but if you 're a woman , you do n't understand it .
so people are creative , we are creative .
and i wish to me and i want to employ that we 're all using any more of these creativity .
a lot of us are in a <unk> <unk> .
and it does n't have to be that way .
why not things do n't different ?
old things we do is that we might have a lot of time or <unk> , and the opposite .
why not just do n't they do it differently , it 's a little bit of simple undersea <unk> .
and there 's this <unk> enterprise , which is what it 's using .
for example , these are the molten <unk> of their operations , and the signs or the person , and you might have that on the wall .
plus a way , or it 's a way , or a choice , or ?
let 's just stay on the coffee with the coffee .
or that .
we do n't have a draft , <unk> you .
is it already already with today , right ?
if you do n't want to do the mobile phone .
or , you know , you 're going to fall both , but whatever we can both .
sorry , but creative .
that 's something it takes .
i 'll just give you the customer or the people who would be going to go into and say , okay , that 's like me .
i 'm going to do the math force .
a <unk> <unk> has the current <unk> <unk> , and it 's in <unk> .
once again , the most news news , even more politics .
if you were there , there 's three on the square , you 're <unk> .
one time the complaint was going to get lessons for a long period of food .
it 's a <unk> building and the restaurant , so the chefs all come to do .
it was too deeply .
they have , in common , what do we do ?
so how do we solve the problem ?
we can not do faster faster .
here 's a big idea .
on every single table , a conventional personality <unk> <unk> <unk> salt , pepper and a <unk> .
that 's why the car could hold in the waiting for the food to the <unk> .
just a way .
a creative idea , and maybe it 's been solved .
there 's one person doing the power right now .
and you have this person in the blue era , so the <unk> of the <unk> .
and now we 're <unk> , the german meltdown .
it 's already the second day , it 's a little bit , so four days .
a company has signed up to the collaborator of month , and you might know what .
a <unk> , if you know , we thank you .
people are going to be looking at what 's going on .
the buses are full of them , it 's going to run <unk> , people have to have <unk> , people , in order to be a <unk> b .
but why not even use something better and creative ?
sometimes it happen to be <unk> , too .
and it 's from a binary message , like this company , you may know .
so we know that it 's not really good at the ikea , but that you have to be able to save the recovery in the burn condition .
or the <unk> in the car .
now , we know the different , <unk> , and all sorts of directions .
yes .
why do n't you turn a piece of tape on the car , when you get it ?
or for example , it 's also possible to make the creative .
and all of that is just with humor , with joy , with sometimes it 's stupid , is the <unk> ?
sometimes it 's funny .
one time my favorite son was <unk> with me in the office .
and you 're sitting on this <unk> .
so , we have several <unk> around the ballroom edge .
and then he walks from the left to the right , he 's up , and i 'm saying , in my geography , i 'm saying , `` well , that 's not a playground . ''
he 's looking at me , look at me , a lot of eyes , playground .
and in the moment , what i did was he right ? he 's right , right ?
why is n't that a playground ?
why is what we do n't , not the playground for adults ?
now , that 's a lot of a <unk> , right ?
if we 're in perspective , if we use our talents , that we do n't like to do .
and so , it 's <unk> , but it 's really comfortable .
now , the argument that it 's worth that if a particular day , the week is what you 're going on in your brain .
it 's the first day of the week , and somehow , our focus on a different day .
so one of the day we have to do is , and it 's a lot of day .
that 's what it was going on .
you hear that you hear it already in the media .
on the <unk> , yeah , it 's just a day to the weekend .
or if the most beautiful time of the year is given to be announced , the holidays testing .
so what are the remaining <unk> weeks ?
is it so terrible ?
have we all been looking for a terrible jobs ?
a <unk> had been on the cover , that 's on the cover .
yes , monday , and the rest of them are asking .
or on giant grass , on facebook , anywhere in social networks will be settled .
and i just like to go through the <unk> , one of the <unk> in the <unk> .
there 's a lot of business , and i look like i want to look at me .
what do you think of that in the <unk> , what else do it ?
and one day i would have to buy a business with this car .
and the first sign you can see here , yeah , that 's pretty good .
so , of course , you know , from working on , rather than working .
i 'm also doing that , i 'm really five kids , but i love my work .
yes .
or still a long term to get to the extent , the <unk> sign .
why it 's your mindset that 's going to be more likely to be more precise , and that 's getting more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more
somebody has a response to this direction , it 's not the monday , it 's your jobs .
and i actually ask you to do with pink break , there 's coming up and say , okay , even , you know , you know .
what about my job is beautiful ?
so that 's stupid , even when it 's the pink glasses , it looks like it .
so , something is not beautiful , it does n't work .
the pink rowers is really quite a <unk> .
and there 's a wonderful way that you would end up with the same 19-year-old .
but too , too , not , do n't they do n't .
where does that , if we do n't change that ?
in fact , the content , our <unk> , our <unk> ?
within the company , outside as a <unk> .
it might be in a system where we feel like the mouse .
the mouse goes into this cycle and it comes and goes and walking , and at some point it 's going to get it into the poor mouse , and they get them out .
what does the mouse look like ?
they do n't know anything else , it 's in the <unk> .
again , and again , the movie several times in a daily way , you might know that the film of the <unk> you 'll notice .
that 's beautiful news here with hay , so she 's doing it , so it 's a real thing and it walks and it walks again .
and what we 've probably heard of as a funny thing that would notice , right ?
or something needs to do that <unk> <unk> .
i went to just as a walk home from the end of a seminar .
and then , as the street under me , it felt very black before my eyes and somehow i have to stay .
the next day i went to doctor , because i thought , what 's there ?
he looked at me and said , physically , physically , physically .
but what about the purchasing factor ?
and i looked at my calendar to see that , and i saw my three weeks , and i kind of spats myself .
after 20 years , in the '50s and the university , the first time in the early days , the first thing in the early '90s , the first thing we can do was we could be able to find the night at night .
i also think , what else is there more jobs ?
and i started to think of <unk> , <unk> , another priorities , to see that i was time with my family , doing something good for me .
<unk> , if there 's not always any other day in my job , a new piece of play .
i 've been assuming the talks of a bunch of big groups that i make my right joy .
i go home counseling and <unk> and other things , but these conversations are to be able to give these talks to experiences that are <unk> <unk> with me .
and that was not always that .
i realize myself that this <unk> makes actually stress in stress .
and sometimes it takes this shot on the front of the front of it , <unk> from me to be sent back to the hospital after he had a heart heart , and he starts to play with it , <unk> .
before i said , you go to the timeline , he always blew me , yes , you 're always running your walk and so .
today , he 's going to be on itself .
so , with <unk> , beautiful slowly , in the right quadrant , but we 'll also go back to this .
what happens ?
we 're going to all have a healthier .
the <unk> go down , but a curve , the amount of the conditions are due to health .
<unk> <unk> four percent in the last last 10 years , six percent minus 50 percent , which is beautiful , that 's going to be less .
rise of the agricultural population plus we have to say , one percent .
that 's something , where i think is that ?
why is this ?
is this just in austria ?
no , even in germany , it 's so .
<unk> , <unk> , that 's all going to be a healthier .
that 's what 's going on here to see here .
right , you know , there 's only plus three percent in the last 10 years , a large german auto stuff .
the number of <unk> <unk> .
plus cost .
and so , all kinds of official , what can we do with this topic ?
and then , what many ideas are also described as a result of how to give up here .
so , good ?
and somebody said , no alcohol , either .
but what is the solutions ?
so what is the things that makes us do with doing healthy and exercise and to joy ?
and that 's what i did for me to do that last year .
i 've got this , and there 's something like <unk> , can it be there ?
i 'm a gamer , the job is not what makes us to play and happy .
there are many other things that are important , family , health , faith and so on .
but the fact is that we spend the biggest part of our <unk> in work .
and when we do that , why do n't do so that it 's us going to be joy and also another .
the <unk> expressway i 'm doing it as a last piece of time to <unk> and for the end of it .
and these little <unk> that you 'll see , hopefully will blow up .
<unk> is now taking a freedom of freedom , freedom and environment .
that 's what 's i my talents ?
in terms of the environment , i do this , too , too , too ?
what freedom of freedom do i do here to do ?
because the one is the <unk> of the <unk> who 's coming forward .
the more of it , the more stress .
and what do i do ?
the bigger process .
and that 's where those four parts are that .
and it can be a problem for yourself .
i had to take that for me to check a few years ago , and i 'm going to make it back to the event .
can i use my talents to the talents ?
in what 's the environment ?
and that means sometimes sometimes i go into a cafe with my laptop , to make the seminar or a <unk> .
the freedom .
and what freedom i can take to do is to do that , which is what matters .
and am i going to do it ?
the bigger process .
the last mile .
and then you have people again , and people who tell me why this is not .
and why that 's a lot of difficulty for you .
and i 'd like to make a response to this place .
you want to find ways of that , you know .
who do n't , who did n't .
and by the point , you can choose to have any of you , and i 'm going to do why i 'm going to do things ?
and they 're right in both .
so what do we do with our dopamine ?
each of you have seen his great <unk> .
it 's too much too small .
this is filled with <unk> , with gold , with everything that are possible with your capability .
what do we do ?
and we 're asking this , and we 're wondering this .
or if we lie in the hospital or a end of a life .
so what did i do with my collaborator ?
by the way , who 's looking at <unk> <unk> , i think , can still get here for a second here .
so , what do we do with our talent , is my first question , too , in my own , and that 's a day every day .
`` is i doing that good enough ?
and resources .
there was one with a story .
i wanted to tell you about the story of the things .
and the thing i do is , i think , in the spot , still .
this was the <unk> <unk> for the most saving war as a previous event ago , was the enemy .
and the enemies realized that this disconnect was so good , that you could n't take them .
seven walls of the world , the <unk> , the <unk> of the agricultural , thick , thick doors , <unk> , <unk> .
it was <unk> at the time .
so here 's what happens , okay , if we do n't get inside , we let a <unk> .
we do n't stop it , and it 's in a place .
let 's take a look at how long , that 's what i 'm supposed to do .
the japanese ones took it from a long to the day , where the <unk> were almost used .
they had a <unk> of that was already on the way than the <unk> of the lung , you 'll be asked this talk , and give me three days .
so , you have , come , you have a seat , i <unk> , come , get the <unk> and you want to .
<unk> is gone to the <unk> .
and then the enemy that the wall of the ceo of the ceo of the ceo of the ceo of the ceo of the ceo of the ceo of the ceo of the ceo of the ceo of the ceo of the ceo of the fortress is a <unk> , and again , the very back above the right to the right , and it 's in the early room .
good , think , a <unk> , what is that .
it 's gone .
again , a <unk> <unk> , the top of the wall , the <unk> , this one is black .
you want to think oh , oh , who has two <unk> , who can take it into a little bit .
at the evening , the same scenario , this is what he knows is he knows the <unk> that it is coming up and down .
at the end of the second day , after the six different <unk> , they turned into a <unk> .
because they thought that takes us for a long time , that we do n't think anymore .
and then the <unk> down the <unk> down to the <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
one thing that they had and they had .
that 's what the <unk> <unk> came from .
i like this idea that everything we need , and we have everything .
sometimes it 's very low resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's little .
but we can do something that we can do something .
we have no idea of power that we have started to invent the world a day .
and if you think that might be a good end of what they 're right .
in the spring , the spring hit the spring .
it 's coming .
and we 're going to know where the snow will be getting away from branches , and we 'll have these neighborhoods to green <unk> .
and then there are some other things that come from these blooms are fruit .
and there 's a little bit of a <unk> here , and we harvest and eat .
there 's grain of this grain , we can <unk> and bread .
there 's any animals that are eating .
there 's a human being , which then , the products are later going to eat .
and it 's automatically coming .
but if you think about it that , maybe it 's not so heavy , it 's going to be a fear and it .
and of course , this threat is that the threat is that the threat is very , very abstract and also very , but at least in the realm of the game , the connection of the <unk> , the connection of the plant , is a very , very big role .
there are research that show that to exist percent of our food , the food , in particular , there would be no bees .
and that sounds like that , because it 's so much for us , and we do n't even like to perceive bees .
now , a very interesting film , also , a very interesting film , to the subject .
and i assure you , look at it .
now , let 's look at the great <unk> of the general , which is working with bees who 's now working with bees who 's in the middle of bees , in <unk> , the importance of bees do this .
this is what he 's doing here at a school school , and he 's going to tell us a lot about his work .
please , mr. <unk> .
yes , good evening .
it 's just a big thank you to step at mr. <unk> and the whole duration .
so i 'm here with my project , <unk> , i 'm going to make some greater life about life of bees .
and even under a wing , under a <unk> something about the little sliver of a <unk> , that 's fun to tell you .
so , i 'll think that the potential of you can be <unk> , it would be a <unk> , a <unk> , you 're going to want to bring into the basics of the brain .
i do n't do that , no .
but maybe i 'm just doing it to make you , you can put these <unk> or a certain empathy to develop them to be <unk> , <unk> glass of the honey .
my name is thomas <unk> , i 'm <unk> years old with a wonderful woman , dad from five kids , and i have different <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> and adults .
i 'm a member of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the lab <unk> .
and now work now in the <unk> world 's <unk> <unk> , in our <unk> , <unk> with our oldest students in the <unk> .
we 're working there in the garden , in agriculture and in the same part .
now , <unk> is a play of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> .
our flying classroom is more a headline , a quiet , a quiet thing .
and she also goes to the quiet .
it 's almost a <unk> .
and not free , the ancient greeks have the <unk> of honey , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> .
and in a wonderful verse of homer , he 's like the <unk> <unk> his <unk> <unk> his <unk> to inspire him that he can blow .
but the smasher best players do n't even get themselves down , but they send their blue and <unk> that skin <unk> and the <unk> , and the <unk> with the <unk> and the chambers , and he later again as honey comes from the <unk> .
it 's a beautiful image .
hopefully , i 'll start this tonight today .
yes .
the flying classroom .
i come to the project .
one of these <unk> , this <unk> , which is now my student , and it comes back to the age of my students to a <unk> program .
in <unk> schools , in <unk> schools , in the <unk> , <unk> in <unk> or <unk> .
a <unk> <unk> , or in south villages , in <unk> ,
the teacher that i 'm accompanied this project is going to speak to me in the class , and we 're looking for a <unk> site for a <unk> .
usually the window to the children with a little see , during the window , the children can see this month .
and all of the things that the bees that then there are in there through the tube and you can <unk> it again .
it 's made a escape at the window .
that 's like that .
and then all begins with me on the turntable of me on the turntable .
so i 'm going to take a <unk> and <unk> ' underwear from a existing sample of <unk> , and you can see you 're here in this micrograph of time .
so this is what we 're doing is that this is so <unk> , so that 's where we 're currently <unk> bees .
and also , we have <unk> <unk> , and here 's a new wave , so we have to be a new <unk> , fresh eggs .
and then you 're a <unk> , you 're up here .
there 's the honey inside .
they need to do it if bad weather is bad , and they ca n't fly .
that 's like that .
so that 's what it looks like .
and then the <unk> <unk> over here , and immediately you 're starting to get it back to the <unk> places , or for the <unk> in the school .
and now , something wonderful starts .
ladies and gentlemen , the bees that then then have a real classroom in the classroom and the experience of a crisis .
you do n't have a lot more .
they 're lonely .
you do n't think your queen .
and that 's the most important problem from the <unk> , when he makes this compartmentalized approach that he 's on the queen and the queen would be in the older people .
so that 's not based on these two <unk> .
and they 're sad , these bees , these bees .
they start to <unk> .
yes , the <unk> says , she <unk> .
you hear that .
they almost almost greater virtual transport than if they normally normally in your wake up with a queen .
and now , a <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , in a night , you now have the need to be a new person , and all of the data is happening without <unk> , <unk> , without instruction , without faith , without faith and positions .
so here 's the people that agree in and then you 're going to have a <unk> in the first night .
because , without the queen , there would be no longer exist after six weeks .
because six weeks , it 's only six weeks .
that 's like that .
and in this first night , she would come out of one of these dung <unk> a square , and you put this in these balloons into the first night .
and then you know , there 's a queen 's going to be the queen .
anybody who had <unk> in high school , says , `` is that ? ''
yes , genetically <unk> , is all genetically genetically <unk> .
that 's true .
and now , something wonderful starts .
this idea , which is what we normally normally have a queen in the <unk> department .
the egg has the first three days of the same genetic code as the <unk> .
and then it becomes a <unk> <unk> by a <unk> .
you know this term .
and immediately , it 's changing on this level of <unk> , the genetic code .
the <unk> , <unk> , they have changed the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> .
we had a moment before what we eat , that determines what we 're going to do .
and the queen is really wonderful to experience .
three days , he egg , five days .
and you can do it all the students .
this is what they 're looking at .
and then this cell will <unk> <unk> with a <unk> and all the whole thing that 's not because the people are now democratic and <unk> , or to a <unk> , you 're going to be a <unk> , you 're doing this .
no , that 's what happens .
ladies and gentlemen , this is a <unk> or a <unk> .
and then the students who will wait eight days every student , three five five eight , eight five eight days ago that this queen <unk> .
and on the day , if you 're supposed to happen , the teacher has the <unk> , the <unk> ratio , the <unk> of the students in the students in the students in the students in the students in the students in the students in the students in the students in the students in the students in the students in the students at the students .
and then the mom says , `` tell , what about you ?
yes , i have to school .
yes , why is that ?
yes , our queen 's <unk> .
yes ?
and then the camp in the morning , in school .
and then you hit their <unk> on this <unk> , because they want to <unk> , like this queen now <unk> .
and if you really want to hear that , you 'll hear something .
this is a queen .
that 's like that .
one more higher .
and then the <unk> and the <unk> are free .
the first thing that this queen does , she uses their wings , and then you have to have the same person with your skirts of the people , your smell , your smell , her <unk> , your <unk> .
the people have a identity .
now , three to five days five days were fed up here .
and from the '50s , you 'll get your <unk> <unk> .
the way back out of the sky , from the people , from this <unk> .
and after five days , these queen came out of the <unk> .
some think now , yeah , i 've seen it , like a <unk> in the <unk> .
stop , get .
and different .
that 's what we let .
this queen 's <unk> on the board alone is no <unk> , from this <unk> , up to two miles .
you 've seen it in your closet .
in the '50s and the <unk> , there 's <unk> , from seven to 12 drones , the male bees .
so , the queen 's looking at the man , the queen , the seven to 12 men .
and this is happening all in a wonderful way .
the drone comes from the back of the queen , and this queen is now <unk> in this stunning world all over all this fuzzy <unk> only these things that she takes to put on seeds , for three years eggs .
and the drone is also an amazing experience .
and if you 're finished with the car dies , you 'll die your and off the sky .
and then the queen comes back and starts to put eggs .
you 're always going to have two students in the class that you see .
and immediately , the queen , the queen .
yes .
and then slowly the project back , the project 's going to be <unk> and the queen and the <unk> will be in a way too close .
and then i come back to this <unk> .
<unk> ' <unk> from the outside , and the next morning <unk> i have these <unk> with the queen and these bees at me .
and there you see the queen .
yes .
<unk> .
and it 's mostly 10 to 12 or 12 .
and then this one yes is , these two data will come here in a <unk> .
in a full cane , in a gulf and now , that 's where we can get this people big and strong .
why bees in school ?
ladies and gentlemen the children who have experienced , never forget that .
yes .
so yes , yes , it 's not just that in this class , that 's the students all of the time in the bees are going to come together , but the whole school comes into this class in this classroom .
and the teacher , if he can do something , if he can be something , when he can get a little prepared , it can be a <unk> in the other .
so , look , bees and you have <unk> <unk> , in a cave , we have cave where people have died of their honey .
a few months ago , you have <unk> years old <unk> years ago , and the people have thought back the bees .
any human culture , with honeybees , with bees .
or the other way that the bees were in every culture .
in china , in peru , in egypt , in egypt , in greece , in greece .
and they were in the same time .
the human cultures ladies and gentlemen , right .
he can <unk> a <unk> , a synthetic scanner , so it can plug a metabolism .
ladies and gentlemen , what flowers or the trees are the common <unk> , what they need ?
that 's what they 're looking at here now is now in the summer in the summer .
that 's out there , that 's a green operated for our bees .
yes ?
and then , in the case of students , he can go to the students in the <unk> and there 's flowers and bees , and you can see flowers of bees , who are looking for them , and look , how long need now to do the <unk> to my <unk> to my flowers ?
how long are you on the individuals ?
and as long as they take back to return to you back .
it can be <unk> .
how do i <unk> a hexagon ?
yes .
you know , if that 's the peak up to the top , or is you still a corner of your city ?
just look at it .
he can -- a more math , a more powerful .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can discover with the students that the <unk> <unk> on this <unk> .
and then he comes to the question , how could karl <unk> of fresh <unk> the nobel prize ?
because he thought that the bees that thinks that you see .
but my ladies and gentlemen , in a notice it 's <unk> .
there 's a bee bee .
and just the professor <unk> , who has many years in university university , who has been in <unk> , that the bees can create a <unk> in the individual .
like a <unk> web from the <unk> web , and now you can make some trace web out of your <unk> and the bees , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the record with her legs with your rose .
you see what these bees do in school ?
it 's <unk> of the people , and the children are losing their fear to the bees .
and developing a awareness of the bees .
they learn , <unk> , is what the bees do .
and they get a message from this , and they get some of these things that they 're basically made for human beings .
the bees do n't create the bees , even a kilo of the people ,
in front of the best way , the only way we make candles .
they accumulate the <unk> outside the trees .
this is a <unk> , where the <unk> you get your people .
and now , think about this , in summer , these are <unk> -- and <unk> bees in this room space , at <unk> degrees .
hey , there 's a huge thing to end .
no , in the bees , in the bees .
because they have antibiotics in this <unk> natural natural .
you can collect the pollen , and it 's that it 's going to <unk> it , it becomes the <unk> , to a <unk> .
someone who 's on the climate 's underwear is , <unk> , <unk> of the world today can go to a <unk> , and you let a <unk> <unk> , by incorporating the <unk> from the people .
of course , there 's an grid in that way and with a <unk> and so forth , and it 's nowhere .
yes , and then , of course , the <unk> of the <unk> experience that the bees of the <unk> of the <unk> experience that the bees , and we would have less apples if the bees would n't fly or we 'd have to be the chinese just on the <unk> and they 're going to be entrepreneurial .
there 's many more insights .
look at the <unk> , there 's the main amount of the cancer , you 're growing up to the <unk> , where the cows are the mud .
and then the bee is where they get to your nectar , and you have these <unk> of these <unk> .
and now the cow and the <unk> the <unk> and just because they can <unk> <unk> , can digest them .
yes ?
and then you put it back and see , ah , yes , yeah , yeah , yeah , ah , i can <unk> it again .
and then there 's milk .
that 's what the bee bee is .
yes ?
and then we have the bee , the bee , the bee , the most valuable , what it exists .
the honey .
i want to come to the point , <unk> .
my students are happy to have a year every year , and then you get to go to the schools .
now , this is not a <unk> , but i did n't have a student , and i said , in the <unk> , i said , in <unk> , you know , `` you know , '' you 'd put yourself yourself yourself .
and then he says , `` well , i 'm hot <unk> . ''
i 'll come from <unk> with <unk> , and i 'm 20 years .
and i 've been in <unk> for five years , and for two years , i was in the <unk> thomas .
and i 'm now , i 'm not going to learn more of the learning to learn to learn how to read the hands .
<unk> , yes , with your head .
and a <unk> was <unk> through the <unk> , <unk> college .
and more than half , yeah , that 's what we want to do .
my students experience a tremendous appreciation and the ones between , in quotes , regular and the <unk> people will be under the bees .
on appearances , you 're looking at and you get self-esteem , my students and a certain proud .
so how do you get to the bee ?
the question is wrong .
you have to say , how do you think of the <unk> of the <unk> ?
and i think , well , there 's the human man who <unk> the other people , and give you a new tool .
and he says , `` start with this . ''
at the end of a small poem , <unk> by <unk> .
who like the bee would be the sun through the sun , and never the direction of the fields in the fields of a moment , he would be crying .
thank you very much .
hi , love friends in the world .
welcome to talk to me .
that 's the project my person and my wife .
it 's the struggle to a end of female genital genital genital genital genital genital genital genital genital genital genital genital genital genital genital genital genital genital genital genital genital genital genital genital genital
in my view , the largest crime of humanity , because it has been used for a hundred years .
society versus women are still going to have <unk> victims per day .
first of all , i 'm going to think of it .
my name is <unk> , i 'm coming from hamburg .
and i was doing a <unk> year .
you can think that the job is not <unk> .
i did n't feel like it .
and i was very happy that i could n't really <unk> myself in the subject of doing this topic of <unk> and <unk> .
for example , this one .
with a massive primer on the atlantic from africa to brazil .
on the spirit of a wake-up , in the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> in brazil was pushing the <unk> to the <unk> of brazil .
that was a journey where i was more more than <unk> , more civilized than <unk> .
but it was still that this thing that was meant to find the interest of media and even a smaller human , and i could make it the necessary in the world .
<unk> , i took with a few of the <unk> in ethiopia 's ethiopia .
at the time there was a war between the western war and ethiopia , and we were <unk> of this decline .
and despite all the cruelty that we were , we were on the other side of the <unk> , which was <unk> us with <unk> , arab hospitality .
and we had put together , and we were put up with our two <unk> , which you see here , when they 're seeing their bodies as living <unk> , and the <unk> they said , that 's my <unk> .
if you want to kill your teachers , you 've got to shoot .
i did something like that in any other culture .
and then in the time , in the age of young , i learned that you 're not predicting islam to terrorism .
but christians do n't want to get reduced to their terrorism .
for example , the <unk> .
the <unk> , the <unk> .
it 's rather than the real values like , as you , social responsibilities .
these are the values to fight it .
after many years , i 've been back in this <unk> , meeting with my wife .
and then we heard about this <unk> female circumcision .
when i heard about that , <unk> percent of the <unk> victims are the rest of the <unk> of the <unk> , the rest of the <unk> are , and then i think , how could i have a <unk> like that , could n't let a clean <unk> in the shoes ?
and the idea was born , the highest leaders of islam to explain the practice to sin .
we were looking for the ministry of soy organizations that we did n't .
we would have to hear that , we would be totally <unk> , the islam is not yet .
i would give me the frank gods .
on the '50s islands , we have started our own organization .
and it was <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
and to do that , we have to do even have a picture of that battle .
and it was an organic problem .
and so <unk> <unk> and i put back into this desert and <unk> and make these images .
the bad <unk> pictures , i 'm not going to show you , but i want to be the crime .
girl in the age of four weeks to the wedding , eventually , to the wedding , and the <unk> <unk> , the earth placed on the limbs and they 're talking to you , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> instruments without any <unk> of conflict and anatomy and the <unk> .
what you 're left is a staircase from the size of a <unk> .
now , let 's play one more <unk> .
if you 're going to get your rule , they 're two weeks .
<unk> destroyed of body and soul , the way it would .
that was the beginning of the so-called <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> is on .
the man has to open it up .
he still saw a <unk> woman .
the uncle said , `` oh , well , i said , well , is n't a problem . ''
you put your penis and then you get some of them .
and if you do n't , it 's not bad .
and you take the knife and you get them out .
that 's <unk> <unk> .
it 's a third of the girls who 's here .
this was a three months ago .
shock before that girl lost his language .
these are the <unk> , even some in asia .
most of them are fiction .
and when all we were muslims , why did you do that ?
it was the most problematic answer , which we have to do , that 's the koran .
there 's nothing in the koran , in the opposite .
and every single event <unk> at a given daily days daily every day , like us , who creator , is perfect , <unk> .
but they do n't seem to think what you pray .
and she 's <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , and why you might be <unk> human beings , to women .
but now we had the pictures of the first few favelas .
he <unk> us to get his whole <unk> course of a conference .
there was a hard conversation , two days , two days .
but we had the minister on our page , the highest <unk> on our site .
and then the great decision , the practice is against all human rights , versus religion , we have to ban him .
and the final thing , the way that carol 's been signed up this new <unk> signed .
and when you know africa and the <unk> you know , it 's only that 's being <unk> for these people .
and it became celebrated and not like successes , we had to other countries .
so , let 's even give you to be <unk> here , <unk> , the highest spiritual , the <unk> of the country 's worth its message , that it 's an crime to write in love and to have the <unk> .
in the days we were on the road , with your own heart .
we have a hundred of them , and we had a lot of war .
and where we came from , we just have open facial ears , open arms and the historic , ancient arts .
and as we wanted to leave the country , the great <unk> and <unk> <unk> , would you really have all the same states of countries ?
so much of life will not be more likely to be there anymore .
he 's right .
i 'm a gamer , and there 's a slow to go slowly .
and all of it was a idea .
he said , if you can get to put the ten <unk> blind in the world to a table , and you can give them the practice for sin , it 's a sin .
<unk> and i flew to a <unk> and -- the mosque are <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> .
and the <unk> for <unk> right , the <unk> <unk> , his <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
he listened to the idea of it , particularly , it 's like what we would finance .
and that 's what we 're doing is to think about things that support us .
and then he said , i 'm going to do n't just <unk> the conference , so as we had asked him , but i 'm going to take the <unk> .
and he did .
over over a year , we found our transparent leaders .
international <unk> in <unk> , is the female <unk> of female bodies .
under the '50s , <unk> doctor , doctor 's <unk> .
and everybody has gone .
a hundred <unk> , but the highest highest .
in the middle of the biafran-nigerian pacific bank , who 's a man in his <unk> and the rest of europe and the cause of the <unk> .
so men can tell the lives and the death .
but it 's also the other .
on the left side of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , my <unk> .
the highest highest .
i think about what i 'm just spending more about teaching me and do n't tell you personally .
and then i was all the sort of thing .
it started the conference .
and under our sign , under egypt , and the <unk> of egypt , of egypt .
the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> egypt , <unk> egypt , <unk> by the wife and <unk> <unk> , germany .
so , as much as a topic , islam is not <unk> .
we had the same time , and the more of the world was also , the more , what 's going on , what 's the more , of course , what 's going on with women 's .
and then you could show up a film , <unk> .
reality .
men were laughing in .
she moved back to the <unk> doors to only two hours , and he wrote a <unk> , a <unk> .
the <unk> is the cameras , people study what you have .
and the most important sentence , that was this .
female genital landmines is a <unk> of crime against the highest values of islam .
he does the <unk> .
we thought , well , the job is done , but it did n't have done the calculation without our <unk> .
because the shame that 's talking about the woman 's writing was stronger , more than any of the mind .
that 's why we have <unk> .
we have this conference documented in this so-called golden book .
a <unk> tool for the world 's population of the world .
and because , as <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , it was so good , the book he did it with a practice .
it will lay us out of hands .
we were in many countries , we had to put on the highest side of the highest side .
and they were uploading this with interest some , they have the book .
however , most of the time , most of the time , the courage to go to too well .
you do n't want to talk about the abdomen , you 're not in the mosque .
just a few people have it .
they went to universities , on <unk> .
and sometimes we 've found some of the elements of a few <unk> <unk> that actually have the <unk> on the <unk> .
and then it goes out of speakers on the <unk> .
and these are the things that are the things .
they 're going to spread it .
but i 'm going to have time of it .
they 're all drop of hot stones , and that 's why i 'm working on many other strategies , this theme .
the practice .
but my favorite thing is that this is what i call .
i want to announce the great embassy of the highest <unk> of islam in the world of islam , which is the kaaba in mecca .
not <unk> <unk> , but in the <unk> .
when there 's four million people , men and women are completing islamic .
and then you know , in all of these , and the owner of king my fortune up there between the '60s .
like i 've done this , i 've got it already with the <unk> .
unfortunately , i believe that last , that 's the <unk> king .
but i 'm sure if he 's going to be <unk> , he would be coming up .
one to help these women .
to the other , to show the world , which is the real values of islam , instead of slipping on forever .
<unk> than a tv .
if i do n't like that , i think , maybe i 'd have the same thing in the hamburg .
at least many of the deep-sea communities in the mosques , again , in the world , all the world .
and we could put our fortune out there .
and maybe i do n't think that little girl needs to have a daughters .
and then my life has so right .
and i want to talk about everybody who 's now here or to stop .
there 's not one more <unk> .
we have to step out the practice that 's on the pandemic , but it 's not that i do n't even get here .
and now i want to close to the design of my <unk> ,
that 's my favorite , my <unk> .
and that 's in all the top of the top of the top of arabic , and you do n't have to get it out of the <unk> and the best you have to do .
down there , we have in german .
female genital is related to the koran and the ethics of islam .
it 's <unk> and an distribution of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so i start out of this .
and this is what the prairies looked like , which you get as a <unk> in germany as a refugee .
on the <unk> , my mother , my brother and i had a package of a certain <unk> .
it <unk> authorship .
my mom was totally disturbed , because she did n't understand why they gave us care of food now .
the third day , we finally have always been looking at .
we stood up at the service , and then the same thing was then a <unk> woman and <unk> that was just against the <unk> .
she tried to explain us to what you can eat .
that 's not practical .
and that tastes very good .
it 's cheese .
my mom took the door to the front of the guerrilla , and we were laughing .
cheese .
in my own country , we have practiced , but it 's not such <unk> .
i 'm <unk> <unk> and <unk> years old .
i 'm with my mom and my mom 's <unk> ,
so from this meeting <unk> , i 'm telling you today .
but , mostly , it 's about giving people who have allowed these people to have and a success story .
but first , i tell you where i 'm from the end of the day .
i 'm a believer .
<unk> are a little <unk> that lives in the northwest of china .
and this region is going to be called autonomous area called the autonomous area .
it 's about <unk> miles away from germany .
china has a million <unk> in china is the largest <unk> community outside of china .
and this <unk> life is because we have to have a lot of <unk> <unk> .
hundreds of thousands of chinese have been building blocks of that we have become a minority in our own home .
our own native language , <unk> was <unk> from the system .
in schools and in universities , is going to be <unk> .
and we 're not going to have free shoreline , and we ca n't have free options .
the appliance community is losing its culture and identity .
and if you 're bold , and for the right , the <unk> of the <unk> ground , or even death , or even death .
that was also the reason my parents decided to flee with us .
that was <unk> and i was back at the time of 11 .
the photo is just a short thing ago .
we had n't had enough money , so my dad had to leave it out .
i 'm <unk> ' for many people who helped us with the escape .
i 'm <unk> ' ass .
i <unk> <unk> , but first of all , let 's have our <unk> <unk> .
i just <unk> him when i was my eyes .
he was big had a <unk> , and we met him with his little <unk> on a parking lot .
the first of the year was being brought .
i know many of a <unk> image of <unk> have <unk> that the only business do n't have any business , and not for the fates to care .
but i wish i 'd like to say , `` oh , '' i said , `` i like `` <unk> '' not as a <unk> .
because he had signed us with this .
he stood up at the airport <unk> , and he summarized on a <unk> and he summarized the last end of the <unk> , and we really came to the <unk> .
airport in the <unk> we came up with this , and i remember , like my mother somehow said to me just out of the airport .
you do n't care .
we 're out there .
because i had a look at my hand , and there was a <unk> , and i was standing on my hand , and i was a stranger named <unk> .
i had to use as a <unk> tool .
and i <unk> ' attention to the handsome monument , and i <unk> my seat in the hand .
silence .
bless you .
a long .
we were finally <unk> .
in munich , i have <unk> ' and i had a whole bunch of career that has been really supporting us .
i <unk> ' <unk> woman who used to be used with us in the <unk> .
in a <unk> with four <unk> per family per families .
at least , at least , at least , children .
a <unk> and a kitchen .
there was a foreign faces .
and many different languages .
and we had no privacy .
my mother , my brother and i had to share a <unk> .
there 's been done , ready and homework .
and my friends get along with this because i was <unk> , where we were doing .
just my favorite <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> knew .
she had seen my story and i got a very , very , and she was looking for me .
for example , she started to me , i 'm not doing anything i do .
but they helped me know , to meet german <unk> .
i spent my whole adolescence in the <unk> .
that was n't just my mom .
in the way of having children without your husband and all the time in which we had one gigabyte and could even get more than any more .
i 'm <unk> ' i was very , very violent .
it 's also a little bit of embarrassing now that 's all about this , but now i have to stand to my story .
i was very violent and i could be really a very violent .
and then they took us to <unk> where we were looking for the first time with normal kids .
with my own normal , i had to have the kids who had to live in a decent line .
i <unk> <unk> myself , and my brother lead to jail or <unk> .
just with that , we can get little out of that .
i <unk> <unk> , and i did n't have done with the number of <unk> <unk> that have done with us , because our parents do n't have a german .
or they 're just lying with it .
we 're always happy .
i still know how we 've always been looking at the fence and wait until these people came , because somehow , strangers , foreign people for us , and that was what we care about .
after two years , finally , my father came to germany .
but the problem was that he was being <unk> by <unk> , because there was no room for him .
i <unk> <unk> from the very , very few songs that has been doing , my father 's <unk> , the <unk> of china , and he managed to have a lot of us in munich in munich in munich .
i <unk> <unk> at this time where i really get to get very , very happy , because after six years , we finally had <unk> in a normal school .
we got a <unk> for three years , and we finally got one extra home with a own bad student and a relationship .
and i had a room , even .
it was a very small and i did n't have a desk inside , but it was good , i could n't go back my door .
and i 'm doing this thing i 've left the time , very good , but i had to leave the <unk> without a week .
i really did n't look for me .
there was a <unk> that i can always give me up in the <unk> , and it still still and still i could be , and i still do the idea that i can <unk> my degrees in my censored <unk> .
first , then the first thing then was <unk> the <unk> .
i 'm very much the teacher that really believed in me , and i was really not just that time , i would have been stuck in the middle of the year .
and i came up with the <unk> .
and before i was to the pet i 'd ever got to the time with my best friend <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is an organization or a project 's project in the organized <unk> .
but i was n't a good job , i did n't just have the only thing , because we had a place where we could just go .
we had a valve that we could <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
and the head of <unk> , we have to tell our problems to tell him , and he was given us to all the questions .
and then i came to the <unk> , <unk> .
and this is a project where young people have no access to a potentially , you know , you 'd better have a chance to get better .
and i did that really do it , and i 've been studying art , art is something that i 'm also doing .
through <unk> and the contact with <unk> , a filmmaker we came up with a filmmaker .
he made the film `` the life of my friends and me . ''
and the film won , many of prices .
we realized that people were interested in our history .
he was a very literal sense of because we had never had the moment to listen .
and that was that moment i thought , okay .
i do n't want to get anymore .
i want to make some of my life .
a collaborator of <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> of refugees , led me to the idea of a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> blackbird .
but i 'm going to go through the back building , i went to a very , very quickly , and the title is one to a while to four .
so i was right .
i was playing .
and the great thing is that after a performance of two editors , they <unk> on me .
and i 'd have asked me if i was interested in taking care of their own .
i thought , well , <unk> .
i mean , i 'm going to do it with .
and i made that <unk> <unk> , and i poured out and i poured myself through the <unk> <unk> , where i was also <unk> in european <unk> .
and i won him .
now i study the grad school for the ministry of justice and movie restoration of data <unk> , and i 've been <unk> the <unk> .
and that would n't have to be possible for me to do n't even have to have individual or organizations like <unk> or projects like <unk> good for me .
they 'd have believed me in the spaces of my spaces , they have shown me ways i can make my place in society .
and so , i 'm now , you know , now i 'm now .
each one of them has given the possibility to help people like me to get some chance to get your life or to find their place in the society .
because the people , you get a hundred hundred refugees from both of the time , and each of them are full of hope , and each of them has a big potential .
they have made a lot of awful <unk> from the terrifying boxes behind .
and with that mandate , they could really be able to be huge profit for germany and for every single one of us .
and i could really tell a thousand things to do what you can do , but i did n't have time enough time , one minute i brought you to give you a <unk> .
now , let 's get your cell phone her , and i ca n't tell you that you ca n't have a ride .
put the code , and then you get on the page of <unk> with a lot of comfort , which they can do .
and that would help us feel good at all .
i 'm now ashamed of remorse , and we 'll see that outside .
and then they put the code .
i do it .
you do n't have a lot of the mobile phone .
you 're so relieved so much so that , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
<unk> .
just a <unk> woman is happening .
so , very , very pleased to me that we have ourselves .
my name is a prisoner of sand .
my <unk> is <unk> as it 's speaking .
i 'll get one of austria , which is in vienna .
i 'm very excited to myself today , is really beautiful .
i 'm going to do that every time here .
and this is not rocket science , it 's a feeling .
yes , yes , unlike the other , i 'm not here today to talk about anything .
i did n't know what .
but it 's so that i write texts in my leisure , and then i 'm doing it , usually , at least <unk> or <unk> , and as you can do the constellations of today .
yes , and i asked to put a few of the texts here , to put the whole program to do that program .
and that 's exactly what i 'm here now .
yes .
i 'll start with a joke .
hit two chickens .
so , you know , you 're two english chicken , so , two english chicken ' past , so , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , i
it 's what other thing is .
and i just ca n't get a lot of times .
so here we have the level of technologies .
the first text is a little <unk> that i wrote a word .
i have it been a person who was partly to what was what he means .
it 's called the title `` the title . ''
and yeah , she did n't understand the back .
when your head was in my lap , your family 's <unk> .
my leg was also under my ceiling on the ceiling .
my leg was through the ceiling .
it 's about your head on my lap , the rest of her , the rest of her , my leg outside of the ceiling .
that 's <unk> , as a <unk> my leg becomes extremely long .
it was very romantic .
the next one , i was also a person who was very much about me .
and my grandpa .
we have no longer contact with no .
my <unk> grandfather was a giant physicist .
already , he has <unk> off a lot of love .
i 'm just like that , yeah .
yes , it 's still a <unk> text .
you wo n't .
jesus is the only one ever ever is at the state of the bus .
but was the point of jesus , he should have save the marathon ?
now , is this starting to think , yes ?
did i have been there i 've been there ?
text text .
the next text is a little bit more .
he 's actually a bit like a hours .
so , for writing .
marcus : it 's faster .
it 's the beginning of a novel that i 'm on the <unk> .
ah , it 's about some guy , so the adventure from a guy who always follow the hair and a little bit of <unk> .
i 'm always going to distance myself again and distance from the <unk> .
because i 'm never cheating from me .
chapter one .
if i 'm going to get my head painted .
so , as a result , that 's what he tried to fill .
yes , i did n't come on .
very heavy , a half .
the next text is also a little four-bar currency .
most people do n't understand .
i 'm going to make myself a hard time for me .
and that 's what i like to play with my favorite and with my language .
i always love with me .
and yeah , they come out of things like this .
it 's called the title `` the title . ''
it 's a little bit very strange .
it 's a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> i ever wrote .
let 's connect .
yes , we have .
we can all of them .
we <unk> .
i was not about .
but i can .
i can do .
i do n't .
yes , i did n't understand it .
no idea .
yes , <unk> from me .
i always tell you , either or no .
the next piece of paper has also to do with text .
somehow , it 's kind of a little <unk> .
i wrote that the back of the insects .
very <unk> .
yes , it 's still a <unk> text .
it 's a little <unk> .
and it 's really cool if i do so that you 're going to do three .
my text is called all good things are cool .
so now , you know , we 're dry out of the world 's now dry .
let 's just give up the <unk> .
so , interestingly , <unk> , <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> , and yes , that 's it .
nice , nice .
yes , even more relevant , which is this time a different .
and it 's really cool if i do so that we could do all of the way that we could do so well so we try all the time .
right , so that 's what the wind is doing .
the lyrics is called the title and the way this is what the other thing is .
yes .
you know , it 's fun .
the average text is just just a sentence .
i write , `` well , little <unk> . ''
this is a bipedal <unk> .
what you have is , with a s s , with <unk> .
<unk> s ?
yes , yeah .
you know , it 's fun .
yes , we have a little bit of a <unk> sentence .
it 's written written in <unk> .
it 's a very long sentence .
i think it 's very impossible to explain to explain , that 's the point .
here , one text is , here 's a text .
this day is a <unk> .
it 's the title of the text .
this day is a <unk> , and he knows .
he already knows before i have him as a <unk> .
he was <unk> by his little <unk> , then he would let me <unk> me .
i could later <unk> it later .
i made him the joy .
it 's a <unk> before every other days , and i would hide back to sleep .
with a <unk> , <unk> in where else ?
and intention , it does n't want to get it more , by looking at me .
and i should wake up later later , and i 'm looking at it , it ca n't have a decent day .
you have hope , right ?
now it 's time for a little joke .
what was the more einstein telling him when he was his steak ?
i 'm going to make it happen .
that 's like that .
so i think that 's what you 're doing is a little bit like the cow .
that 's funny .
yes , the next text has learned the paper .
it 's more what political .
so , i write , i do n't write funny things .
i write , also , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really
and i often ask you where i 'm doing <unk> .
and , yeah , i wrote this text here .
he 's wearing the title `` <unk> . ''
my father came from vienna , and then i got it in my mom and i made it .
yes .
if we would have the same thing .
thank you very much for the sound .
yes , in this case , i like to make a little advertising .
i ca n't have any business or anything like , so i have to keep doing this .
and i 'm also doing myself with myself , and i also make a 30-minute place in vienna .
so , you know , you know , you know , can come to a game .
and yes , i 'm <unk> , i really <unk> out of this .
and , yeah .
i just said that .
it 's on the program .
more advertising .
this is a little advertisement i wrote .
feet .
rich of vitamin c .
so the <unk> .
half of them .
it 's been very fun .
i want to write a joke about your friend 's 13-year-old friend , but the punch was just flat .
yes , it 's not a <unk> of my <unk> .
so , you know , you 're going to put your <unk> label , the top of the <unk> you 'll get your place to the top of it .
yes .
thank you very much .
her were great .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
let me begin to a <unk> question .
why would you ever run your policy at all ?
i think everybody who 's used to be asking is , if he can give up at least , he can give up to the other part of the society .
and the answer is quite clear .
we now know that the life expectancy at the time we only know about the birth is a <unk> area genetically modified .
that 's what you have to do is to have any peace of government , whereas have to have the impact on the planet .
why do n't we know that little bit more like this ?
why are we taking out of <unk> news from the <unk> of the <unk> that we want to confront for part of each other each other ?
and you might have found a two-year <unk> of the <unk> .
it was fat .
and you 'd like to go out of food , we 're all going to watch and get healthy old .
what 's happening in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of the various <unk> in american languages , and what has nothing changed in the american is that the americans are cut up every year .
and then you have said , well , no .
but not the fat .
they 're the carbs .
and then what 's happening is the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> and so forth .
so it 's going to go back to new york and again , it 's a village town .
where all the <unk> ?
well , the reason to my favorite part is to come to my fancy , at least , we 're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
it 's the most example of a <unk> cloud .
the <unk> you know all of them .
<unk> published a much more elegant magazine .
the top of the <unk> <unk> for the last year .
and keith <unk> was a quick film in a time .
then the newspaper died .
or this lady here .
<unk> <unk> .
the oldest man who had ever lived on the earth .
<unk> years old .
i know there 's somewhere there are six times , but you ca n't find your <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is actually <unk> .
and they listened to smoke with <unk> , but with <unk> <unk> , after then , after <unk> <unk> , to follow the path of virtue and to smoke .
with zero-sum people , they have died .
so what does that tell us ?
do n't even know violent .
but it tells us that perhaps is very complicated and that we need clean statistics , we need some basic systems and we have to ask simple questions .
so , you know , the thing to do is very simple , and a very simple thing that 's in different countries are women 's women will be older than men .
what is that ?
we know it now .
so , that 's what the actual action is is what is produced in the male <unk> .
and there 's some simple proof of that as the women are being as old as women .
now , everyone for yourself to think about whether that 's a <unk> device .
austria is a force country .
but it 's getting better , not fear .
we 're supposed to do with <unk> <unk> .
sound complicated , but it 's just to be like to illustrate .
so , here 's a <unk> , and you 've got a lot of grandma and asking what do you do so different or otherwise , that they have become so old ?
oh ,
the africans sent every day 10 to <unk> .
this is probably the secret of your age , right ?
and you do n't have <unk> that 10 times .
or but you would have <unk> and the <unk> would be even older .
even the hard statistics are not always <unk> .
there 's a very hard thing that people show that people are in the <unk> , they 're going to be older than people who do n't .
165 .
it 's wavy .
is that <unk> <unk> ?
no .
it 's because people just have enough money in the pocket to care about your age and the <unk> .
but if i 'm a group of <unk> a <unk> for food and received those group together with 20 percent longer , but otherwise , the <unk> you do n't have in the diet of diet is a <unk> aspect in the diet of diet .
and indeed , these are actually made manual .
so you have to tell you , the most sophisticated thing to be upbeat is , but even i 'm suggesting with my enemies , is that fierce <unk> are separated .
and that works for all of the things .
for example , bacteria .
you 're seeing here , there 's a <unk> bacteria .
when we 're doing the fast , the <unk> line , the very distinctive thing that 's happening is that longer .
same thing is true for <unk> , <unk> electric control , and recently , about two years ago in the united states , that it 's even for monkeys .
it 's not about being thin .
it 's also with <unk> the <unk> .
and this is another experiment experiment in the united states .
what did you do here ?
you 've taken out <unk> , and it 's a so-called <unk> , and you have a <unk> , a <unk> diet where they have so many <unk> from the day and night .
and who 's saying that the mice are thick , sick , sick , and have <unk> all horrible <unk> and bad <unk> .
now , you 've got to innovate with this <unk> , and that 's exactly the same number of <unk> only only was happening only that was all the reports of that was happening .
they do n't have to eat anything food in the night , they were twice as much .
and these progression dynamics of lawsuits and healthy and it has not a <unk> .
even though they have been <unk> .
both of them have a lot of it .
one of them and the other healthy .
so what happens ?
it becomes a process called <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
whenever they take organisms or cells and cells take away the organism , you put certain lines in the cell or injured entities , to make it back to the same way .
that makes sense .
and that looks like .
you can see how in the cell , you can see , in the cell , you can see , in fact , the <unk> <unk> .
and then the <unk> then transmits the constituents in the back and the cell will be <unk> and the cell <unk> .
this is what they 're in the ancient face of the brain in boundaries .
that 's what 's the molecular <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> cartel often .
so , to put it into a range of water , it 's living in different organisms .
and it 's probably something that works in humans .
and we 're learning that they do n't just like in <unk> , and you 're not learning that they 're not going to fight to 20 people at 20 .
no .
it 's what you 're saying when they have hunger , oh , maybe it 's going to be the <unk> .
you want to do your hunger as a friend .
and that makes a difference in mind .
now , over the 2008 , nine nine nine percent of human history has nine percent of human history , what if he had hunger ?
right , he 's gone .
we go to refrigerator in the fridge when we have hungry .
and that 's safe to biology .
now , of course , we know , of course , and this is where the mind is , in <unk> chapters , <unk> <unk> , who 's willing to be , but the dog is weak .
the garden looks very different from us .
so here 's a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> garden .
the three three thing here is well , the food all day , let 's have signed .
and that 's sort of the actual <unk> problem .
so we did that in the search for the door , which is the molecular answer of the <unk> , even though the organism eats .
that might be interesting for people to do it interesting , whose <unk> <unk> are not enough to be <unk> <unk> .
and it might be a real world 's hardest life of life .
so the question is , is the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , even though you eat food ?
and we have a lot of a hundred , and the thousands of bush , the natural <unk> .
we have found one that 's actually a <unk> .
<unk> is a substance that has all of the things in all of the things , but it 's in all of the organisms in all organisms .
in the skin , it 's on the <unk> .
low-income people have a much less <unk> of <unk> in the skin .
and if we 're spending yeast on human cells , for example , you 'll see the following .
that 's the thing you see here is the cell .
so , the <unk> , the <unk> , we 're seeing a lot of these little <unk> in the cell , the <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> cells would look like this as well .
and that works in all different organisms .
so , for example , here 's a <unk> .
so we have found that molecular <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
life is the way it 's longer .
and the answer is again , you know , there 's a typical line of <unk> <unk> from a <unk> .
it 's simple marketing planes .
after all , the dead age , all dead , after a year , is roughly half dead .
whenever we give out to drinking water , here in some they are getting older and survive better .
we also know that human cells that we have <unk> <unk> 's <unk> <unk> , in another way , about three times as long as long as long as a result , if we put them with the <unk> .
and recent research also fits close to the lives of the life of all of the world 's dominated by <unk> .
and it 's not just life , it 's the most populous .
these mice are totally <unk> .
so ,
now you all want to know , where is unmanned ?
like the name says it says it 's been discovered in the sperm , it 's been discovered in the face of a very high nearby .
but i can also be freed out of <unk> <unk> , and a product from <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> , which is so <unk> <unk> from a lot of glacial cups .
we then said , if you think about the <unk> against the <unk> , by using the <unk> of the world 's consideration ?
you have to know that the common denominator of all the waste diseases is that during the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of
and we did some experiments in doing experiments .
you 're going to wonder , we have the ability to use things .
now , they 're also resorbing when they 're getting old .
they have more <unk> in the brain when they 're old .
and the molecular mechanisms that are in memory is just like people to humans .
now , you know , now , how much does the guy have been measured from making things ?
this is the experiment we 've done in common with the pittsburgh school .
you take a hundred grains of fruit flies and you want a smell that you loved .
<unk> .
and let 's have this <unk> <unk> .
and then you take the same fly , give them into the next chamber , and you give them some of the other ones you love , which you love is , which is <unk> .
let 's have the same <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
and then you take the same fly , do the same thing in the place .
the driving you on the brakes here is this slide into the elevator , there 's the same thing .
and if you 're here down there , you 're going to give you on the one hand , and you get your hand on it .
so where do they all go ?
it 's clear .
to <unk> .
except here .
these are the <unk> sites .
or , let 's have character .
i love my favorite and i love `` i 'm not going to <unk> me through this way ''
okay .
but it 's the form of the character that 's growing up with the age of the age .
not just with flying .
and we could actually eliminate the <unk> of the fly , through a <unk> , on a <unk> level .
and the <unk> that were in the brain was then broken again .
that 's what it means , <unk> does n't just be resistant to the ground , but also against foreign diseases , possibly , perhaps .
and that 's important , because we do n't want to increase the living condition of surveillance .
it does n't make sense to prolong time the time of the <unk> .
and i do n't want to leave you , without giving you some really convey some of them , we might be younger .
even more fast ,
it 's not about you or so much .
there 's a lot of time in austria in austria to be group of <unk> people who ate a day and a day , and a day , a day .
that 's what 's called the <unk> <unk> of the line of hollywood and liquid .
and they think that very good .
that 's what it means is rigor .
it 's not rocket science .
it 's not about conventional complex carbs not even being dangerous .
it 's really about candy .
you know , they 're struggling to be selectively , to kill diabetes , even when they 're in sync .
and you know that sugar can be spread from tumors .
you see , you 're looking at the <unk> that 's on the ground .
it 's after 30 days , all the dead .
and low affects of glucose rich .
to create a <unk> effect .
there 's just one example that 's working in almost all of the things that are happening .
food is eating vegetables and vegetables .
and avoid the gift of a lot of <unk> , or the <unk> ever .
you know , you know , <unk> -- and <unk> cancer .
that 's not under vitamin d for vitamin d .
we might be here here , perhaps in the winter , because vitamin d is going to get on sunlight in sunlight .
some of you have a few of times per week , which is a trivial one .
in spite of the lowest world , operators of the only two whales have been visited 10 to four years .
if you look at the very feeling of the eternal <unk> , you have to feel like this .
the influence of pray and blood pressure is <unk> .
because the oil lives almost as long as women .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , living longer than <unk> .
<unk> life longer than <unk> .
but still <unk> life still as a <unk> .
only <unk> babies are used to die as a <unk> .
what is that ?
people assume that what happens to do with some of the world .
no way , no way , that 's very easy .
now , a <unk> on the window is now , i 'm going to get it to <unk> <unk> .
and what 's happening in your business is happening .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> , and so what , they 're <unk> under the circumstances .
that 's why , of course , alcohol , has been <unk> .
a fixed partner , or a fixed partner with longevity .
they should n't live on a much more exotic road .
now you think about the same <unk> .
but that 's what it did with nothing to do with nothing .
it 's about improving .
you can measure , you can be able to measure a much more integrated street , the more <unk> , it 's on blood .
and that 's when he says , i used to do it .
i can just sleep well and the sound i do n't do .
it 's not true .
he still has more complex in the blood , and that 's bad .
the world should be saved for <unk> of course .
we now know that there has a good number of effects .
especially , it can be <unk> .
and we also know that happiness and <unk> mice protect us against the global population .
and that ended up our grandmothers have been looking at <unk> and so forth .
it does n't make sense .
several studies came out that darkly gives the <unk> against the additional chocolate .
now , a beautiful study recently , which has shown that there 's a 3,000 trial , a single day , a day , <unk> on the ranks of a <unk> .
and what you might think of coffee is the most of the most secure .
there are studies that show there , there are studies that are not showing that .
what 's clear is that coffee is against diabetes , and so their metabolic metabolic function performance .
and , of course , this is also a good <unk> because he solves the <unk> of how we could show up to <unk> <unk> from paris .
so , very beautiful and a half study in the hundred people , people have been studied for two years , that people , who are spending a handful of people who are eating every day of a hundred percent .
that 's an enormous value for a hundred years .
and this applies for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
but not for peanuts , the <unk> of the brain is actually <unk> .
the only thing about them nuts is , okay ?
but that 's actually a matter of action .
so for you , you 're not .
the next item is a little bit .
and it 's basically the shot of a lot of animal protein , so from meat and dairy , but only when they 're between <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
so , very beautiful new study , they show that they 're spending a lot of animal protein , they 're spending your <unk> so much more than if they were a big treat .
that 's not for the time after the animal protein , and it 's not true for children kids or adolescents that need the water , and it 's not for pregnant and those who want it .
it 's generally , you know , it 's generally , you know ,
whatever you do , you 're not obeying the end of the unconscious , the least , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the health .
everything <unk> is about the labs .
this is the gentleman <unk> <unk> of this regimes , and he 's got <unk> to become a <unk> .
it comes from my home from <unk> , it 's never sick .
and he 's very good .
he 's just not a <unk> , but he lives in a <unk> , where there 's a lot of healthy people who are special .
it 's about the most robust industry , which i told you today .
we should n't be familiar with all the pits of the world 's greatest understanding of the world 's greatest fact .
and that 's the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , to me , no biological but a <unk> , and it seems to be a <unk> .
you can see the old people less less , and that 's the most profound mistake of our culture .
<unk> wrote the biggest novel in the <unk> of his death .
the brothers <unk> .
a work to the present , especially the teenagers <unk> .
thank you for your attention .
i want to start with a question that i 'm going to give you .
one question where is nobody who have to get up to get up to get up to get up to get up with this , is a little more powerful who is lonely ?
the <unk> is very small .
less than i thought .
but it 's probably probably reasons why they were not going to have the same thing , even the people who would be <unk> .
and many people are <unk> and loneliness and loneliness and think of <unk> .
and that 's not the case of the case .
now , surprisingly , burma is really a matter of people as being alone .
maybe it 's also that you 're not going to have been celebrating , because the question is that the question is .
do you feel like you , or is you fake ?
you can feel lonely being being lonely .
and you can be lonely without being lonely in the moment .
and i also shared , to do with shame .
and that 's now taken up here to me , too gradual .
i 'm making a shame , and shame , leads to a paralyzed .
i need to do a lot of a magician .
so now nobody will have shown here today , in the few seconds , i gave them .
i need to have a very broad idea .
i need to think of the time to get their way to the point .
and loneliness also needs to talk about it .
and we do n't own a lot of practice .
we do n't have the language for ourselves , when we 're lonely ?
there 's a <unk> of loneliness , which i 've always been in and over again .
one part of humanity says , you 're lonely .
from the birth to death , you 're just lonely .
there are few moments in life where you can do the gravitational flow of the world .
these people are often getting back and down the whole day .
i do n't have time to do that .
and then people have less , maybe in the way , it 's all connected to everything .
now , that i 'm not really not there , so i 'm just a part of the universe .
and there 's the big group of that i 'm also the time that 's like , and that 's what i 'm going to think .
so , you know , i 'm lonely and the next day , oh , it 's all on each other .
if we think of loneliness , we 're always seeing the very great privilege .
the loneliness of the fate of the <unk> of the jerks in a die of care .
but over these <unk> , over these major <unk> , i do n't talk about this , but i want to talk about the little talks about the everyday <unk> , where i can also give us in such a theater .
i do n't want to talk about burden and <unk> of the <unk> .
i was loneliness to other destruction , mostly not hard to us , at least , we know , we know , we know , we know , to the disposal of other sense .
the photographer took me in the footsteps of the day , i would have made a couple of photos that i want to show you .
as easy as it is to cure in other words , at other people .
we all know whether these people really were lonely at this moment .
but who knows it , the moment of this <unk> event , where you think , everybody else , you 're lost , you lost the corner and does n't have any squared .
all of these all of these things know how to know here .
maybe some of them have experienced this today .
what you 're doing is that you 're going to do the cell phone , but that 's very good at this point is , you can see a very good place , the <unk> , the <unk> you can not have the <unk> on the cell .
clearly , you look at the display you look at your display .
so , what we do n't do here .
yes , and then there 's the loneliness that you 're looking at that , you know , a <unk> on a <unk> of <unk> sticks in a <unk> radius of <unk> faces , and you 're just abandoned in hope that you do n't even own .
these are the <unk> you see from the outside .
people .
but i 'm sure there 's also the people in the room that are in the room that are in the room that are in the room that are in the room that are in the room that are in the room that you feel like you feel in the <unk> , they 're trying to have the whole life so far as they 've tried to distract these loneliness to the <unk> .
and there 's also people who are lonely , because they have to remove the lonely , because they have to hold death for one other , because of a separation .
there 's nothing that way that many people , also people who are connected with them , they feel lonely .
and there are people who do n't find yourself more and not touch , and they 're lonely .
i 'm <unk> the digital charts .
and leave you to the blind list .
the other thing is given us with us .
these are people who think of their opinion to social contacts .
and that 's all quite relative .
there 's no such thing that are n't a <unk> number when someone else has enough human human activity when they do n't .
we 're looking at this old guys immediately immediately .
it 's the <unk> form of loneliness .
since then , we all over cities in cities , in the very many people , in the facebook or maybe twitter or facebook or facebook or facebook , these are the digital event .
you can be connected to hundreds of people without being connected to one single person .
it 's the analog toxic to the <unk> of human relationships that are lacking in the digital settlement .
the two forms of loneliness is a very often <unk> .
and that 's true of the world of the world of the world of a little bit of a <unk> in the world .
whereas digital loneliness is good for <unk> and <unk> .
it 's just to be used to be a digital donor in the future , if the possibilities of connect to connect , to connect , to connect .
i do n't know if you 'll be very similar to our very much as much as a very similar to be very similar to be a very similar to call .
or if you 're going to find a new type of noise .
but that 's also the problems of the infinite generation .
nearly greater than the loneliness itself is the very fear of loneliness and the fear of the loneliness , people are doing some of people .
<unk> , the big <unk> , even a <unk> , a wonderful <unk> .
in the mind , they 're doing everything that people do , to be not alone .
they build cathedrals , they build their own children , and then they 're lonely and they 're lonely .
but the <unk> never <unk> them to draw the fear of loneliness to the paralyzed , money .
<unk> .
things 's wrong .
and then over the process , the loneliness , because it 's a touch , at least , it 's a touch , and the items that you 've had them .
problem is just that it 's helping to be really short and it 's holding that one upside-down against loneliness .
so we have to get new things back and again , and we have <unk> things .
i have seen the advertising for a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
and the <unk> , very much , <unk> of cell phone , which is what it was doing with the idea of a <unk> .
what this is going on is to do that , you know , but apparently it works .
so loneliness is nothing with the <unk> to do that , to do it with people exactly so .
<unk> <unk> has written a wonderful poem , and there 's a text , but at the worst , i think , is loneliness to <unk> .
hand on the heart , who does n't know ?
in a relationship , or the other people who look at the <unk> and feel terrible about feeling terrible and bad , terrible and feel terrible about feeling terrible and ask to ask who 's this person ?
so , did i do something about this with this ?
one study that 's what was saying women in the audience were going to get women in the ages , you feel , you feel .
it 's not possible to do that i do n't know if i had n't met the trial , i told you .
but it 's also not really ignorant because it 's mostly not really anyway , and the reaction is always the same people before .
that it 's a little bit of view , it 's a <unk> .
i do n't think about it , and yet we 're not speaking about them .
talk about the loneliness to sex .
and that 's probably what everybody had experienced .
so , while you 've been building <unk> , suddenly , do i have to think ?
who is this person in my bed ?
and i 'm also able to do that , the form of loneliness does n't necessarily have to do what 's going to do with the quality of the sexual .
there 's nothing needs to do with the quality of relationship .
it 's just a simple thing .
we do n't talk about them because we do n't look at it .
we 're just talking about them in the workforce .
in the workforce , the loneliness is loneliness as we think .
i was <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , and i noticed a group of five <unk> , better , three juvenile suit and two profiles .
both men have been engaged , both women have been engaged in the classroom .
and in between , something <unk> , something <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> .
i mean , i have n't really take to do this , and i 'm not going to take you on this shape of loneliness , which everybody has ever seen in his career .
it 's the loneliness of the <unk> .
but also , it 's the loneliness of the soprano .
we all know the same problem or i see , here might be some of your life in <unk> .
in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , the often who do n't know who they 're doing .
where they are , where they wake up .
and this is a form of loneliness that 's not spoken .
it 's also known as loneliness as a <unk> .
that 's what it 's like to be with here .
i 've been calling a fulbright that he was called to cover , and that 's said , it 's what 's happening on , you ca n't imagine you .
a <unk> , only in the lunchroom .
it 's been <unk> itself with the ballroom building .
and two months later he 's also hired .
the loneliness is never quite about .
it 's always going to feelings in the relationship with other feelings .
she 's got beautiful siblings , and she 's got a little bit of siblings .
the real one , we all know about all of us .
fear , sad , anger and shame .
but we should n't forget the good milk .
the freedom that the desire is the thing that drives the most smart .
and my right now my own is the loneliness .
it 's coming in and the <unk> and the tide .
let 's take them and do n't let it .
because there 's a little more than the loneliness , and that 's the empty , which may be the <unk> you might have to do .
so , consequently , it 's part of life .
and since i 've been thinking about loneliness , for me , have been changing for me two things .
i 'm not going to get the <unk> dictator since i 'd have a <unk> dictator since i 've ever had , i always have a cycle of why he does n't sit his way , because i am , i am losing the people , maybe i am lonely i am .
i 've done , i since i 've been seeing my loneliness in my life , people come to come and go .
it 's the <unk> <unk> that makes you that .
and i 'm also going to have free .
people come and go to , they 're not going to move forward to the ticket , whether they could n't provide a <unk> or a million , a million .
as a child , i found my parents incredibly embarrassing .
you ca n't come to any <unk> meeting without someone to start with somebody .
whether the diy or the economy .
every time it led to have a universal conversation .
and as a child , i found that what i found .
as a young age , i was an adult farmer being able to have this openness to have this openness .
but it was only since i have started to deal with the loneliness , i was going to get it to me , and then i would have to open up this way .
you can see the lonely `` you 'll do it , '' you will want to get your hand for the next .
thank you very much .
yes , thank you very much .
i have three records here .
a <unk> and a <unk> .
and now , what do i just have you to do that , you know , what 's you ?
most of them would decide for the most vulnerable .
and that 's a really good idea .
and why ?
because we make effort to make this with the complete effort .
in fact , you do n't think differently .
and we let the biggest effect on the world 's completely eight and we 're going to choose to the other strategies .
we 're choosing to give us the <unk> and the reason for sports .
big <unk> but big effort .
so i 'm not that precious .
or we 're telling us the ballroom wizard .
it 's for diet .
again , there 's still very big effort .
so i 'm not that 's not that valuable .
and i want to share with you today , how do you want to make the <unk> of the world 's goddamn .
if you 're dealing with prevention and health , you do n't really have to do it .
and the topic is that it means .
and the topic that it was in germany do n't matter , so to the <unk> .
and then the number of people in germany are strong .
and i asked myself , what was there in the <unk> ?
why did n't this go up to the top of all the way ?
and then i did research , and i 've become a <unk> .
because it was in the years .
what was there ?
there 's a <unk> in germany .
and we 're always going to get and getting it up ?
and i went on .
<unk> comes up to germany .
and that 's what it goes .
and in the years , the curve takes a look at the ride .
and then , what do you think , what do they do ?
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and the way that is all .
and we 're always going to get and getting it up ?
well , i got one and one on the other .
because it was clear .
sports is dick .
and of course , i do n't think about you that sports is made dick .
because that 's not true .
but one of us have found in common .
the deluge of always new school -- and <unk> is not led to us that we 're going to get <unk> and healthier .
so what is it ?
that 's diet ?
and there 's really amazing trial from the states of the states .
and they 're also the problem with obesity .
and they 've gone into the <unk> economy .
and then you wanted to look at a little bit , what is happening ?
and you 've seen that people are still less fat on but the other still still get up , but still being more .
and that was the paradox .
and so they called the <unk> .
so we can explain that ?
and you can think like a power station .
so here we have this big <unk> .
and on one side , a <unk> , because of the way , there 's all the <unk> on it , which are burned here .
and here 's the energy as a power .
now , if we 're spending more <unk> here in our power than we use the energy on the power and it 's bang .
the human body does not matter by the same .
it can store the energy .
and it 's in the form of fat .
our greatest and <unk> <unk> .
but what happens then when we 've heard less like we , energy , and yet we have <unk> , and we 're <unk> only just end up .
the waste rate has dramatically <unk> .
so here , there 's no life going on .
we 're just mobile phones .
and that 's what happened .
our grandparents were going to go to 20 miles .
and we 're now today today , to two miles , and that 's the positive estimates .
there 's studies that report from five -- to <unk> feet .
i 'm going to tell you a little bit with my friend , mike .
you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
mike , do you have a degree ?
mike is american .
he 's shy , he 's not going to talk much .
and he was in the back of this trial , and now here is now .
he 's this typical <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and he has a <unk> in the hand .
and mike 's getting less and less , and still , he gets <unk> , and yet he becomes thicker .
why ?
because mike 's only sitting .
and i watched , like , like , a lot of movement , i was looking for a day in the bag , and i was looking back in the morning , and i was back to the evening .
and there 's a thousand of many moments .
that was the distance , mike <unk> , in the car with the car in the car , and then they came back to the car in the office , and then back back to the evening .
and he came to thousands of each other .
that means mike was a day of his legs at this day ,
<unk> hours and a half minutes , he said , `` he was mike .
under this condition , this condition is defined by itself .
and mike will not be breathing by being much thick because he 's too much more sophisticated , because he still leaves the light , and it 's still used to get thicker and the energy <unk> .
and first , the energy you 're seeing here is what you see here at his <unk> .
but energy is <unk> that stays not .
the <unk> at some turn back into <unk> blood .
and it 's the active and <unk> and quiet and little <unk> .
so the blood flow .
so when you look into the energy in the blood , then speaking of the doctors and high family <unk> .
and this individual , the <unk> , you know , they 're getting small holes in these balloons .
and a happily restaurant , because the whole fat of all the time , and that 's what they put on these little wounds and the vet 's like these little wounds and we talk about <unk> or <unk> .
and now , <unk> heart comes out is right under pressure , because now it 's got to take blood through this narrow <unk> <unk> , and we 're talking about blood blood .
and when this high then hits it , you 'll get it into such a body , it 's true of the body .
and if the best thing is happening , we call the heart attack .
and if that 's what we call the stroke .
and also in germany , every second of heart , every second of heart , every second of heart , every second of heart , every second of heart ,
that means germany , every second of <unk> .
and then , it 's not so sick because he does n't have any sports but it does n't move because he does n't move in .
and if you do n't know that all the context , you 'll just look at the wrong place .
for example , a little bit .
i was still a diet , and even a diet , a little bit , a little bit , at the amazon , and there 's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , right .
and when every book just a centimeter is a inches , and we would have <unk> this <unk> , we would have a 30 meters of high foot high .
and i 've read the time for you .
and there 's up there , and this is actually important when you 're getting up , you 're getting up dick .
and if you 're much less than they 're getting out of you are <unk> .
that 's brilliant .
but why do we need to get more sophisticated books ?
and that 's what makes you one end .
the need is , of course , is huge , but of course , it 's not help .
because why does a diet a hundred percent ?
because it 's a diet , and not a lifestyle .
what are the things we 're doing here three weeks and here five weeks when we go back afterward , after this struggle , again , in the normal life , go back to our normal lifestyle .
so what else do you think of five or seven weeks ?
nothing .
except , again , and again , a <unk> of confidence we did n't have done what we 've been doing .
so you can have a new diet , in every new government rides , and you want to integrate that in your everyday lives , in their lifestyles .
yes or no ?
and then , when it 's shaking .
and if you just keep it , they 're just .
because if there 's nothing out , it 's bad time .
it 's the habits that are going to decide about whether we are going to be sick or healthy .
they 're the bad habits that make us very much .
and it 's the good habits that we have healthy .
and when you look at the mirror , it 's the result of his everyday lifestyle .
when mike goes into the mirror , he 's there his daily habits .
and when you look at it , you can look at the mirror and you 're honest , it 's also where it 's on the road .
because if he 's more bad habits more bad habits , he 's just in the direction of disease .
and when mike in the direction of health , his dreams , he does n't have to get your life to life .
and then he just need more good habits than bad .
and a <unk> , and it 's also a great example of that the person is already a strange animal .
mike has done for example , motion from its daily lifestyle by paying every item , any monkey uses .
and at the evening , he 's sitting at the couch , and it 's got somehow <unk> into motion .
so he sits down in his front of the shoe , there 's a rabbit , in the end , there 's a band where you 're on traditional frog and then , like , it will be certified to a band , so it 's kind of moving into motion .
and my grandpa would have exactly as much as they as they would .
the <unk> was , and not understood that .
and the one would have said , sports is to people who do n't move .
and somehow he 's right .
why do we have to do the thing in the world we have ever been on the field of the day ?
but in fact , we have to do today with this <unk> lifestyle two hours a day .
and then , it 's a lot easier to get there , and you lose it to be there where we lost them .
in the day of life .
and so , i 'm now in a way that 's why i 'm going to invite you today .
and you may have the situation you 'll go at night , you 'll drive it fast for the street and they 're going to have a lot more time in the first range .
and it 's what you see , as it 's <unk> , this <unk> thing we 're in .
we want to keep going to go to the creative routes .
we plan to do our apartments so we have the diversity of nature .
we plan to do our whole life that we have the most advanced way of nature , but we do n't have to see where we <unk> .
it 's in a totally different direction .
that 's why today , the way you 're allowed to activate the dopamine receptor and the movement there are going back to where they are .
i 'll like to play for the sake of the present .
and i 'm the only one who always comes up and down and up and it 's all the rest and the way all the other .
but if i 'm there , i 'm doing my time for me .
i 'm going to do the movement that just lies in that .
and when you get the <unk> , you get 30 minutes , `` i 'm going to <unk> . ''
<unk> steps .
that 's about three times 10 minutes .
and a <unk> <unk> , and if you 're going to have a day of a day , now , you know , the end of the day , the end of the day , 12 of fat would n't get to your body .
and you know , you know , you know , you know , that might sound pretty much .
but as a <unk> , a habit began to talk to us talk about four degrees of calories .
we do n't have our bodies .
and you give me on a degree of time , i always <unk> him .
the americans are bad nuts , the picture of that .
this is a <unk> from five pounds of fat .
you are at four kilos .
just so you can see what happens to these little things .
and if the effect is from this perspective , what i think is what 's going on when you actually start into the <unk> life .
and these tuna that are going to get over today every day in your day-to-day life .
once you 've gone from <unk> steps , they 'll walk close to all the time .
and then , if you wanted to think about , and then they 're going to do that on the ground .
and then they have <unk> even more .
then you 'll still get faster and stronger .
but they do n't care about sports .
so , they do n't care depending on your feeling and from your time .
because the most important thing about this is the most important thing that 's doing it now is now as lifestyle .
and i <unk> <unk> a collaborative lifestyle .
and for me , it 's more than a lifestyle , for me , it 's a <unk> that makes you feel the one on the very clear choice is what life and for me .
because i believe health does n't have to do what we should do or do .
but health has to do what we want to do .
and so , i 'm just a idea for you .
they 're just going to be at least for the best one days .
and it 's now , you know what it is .
step forward .
thank you very much .
so , what did it have a leonardo of vinci , and it 's so incredible , so i think , in the way , some way to see the world in other eyes ?
and so , even so far on the amount of what 's happened to his time just simply so much given to time ?
so would we even have that today today ?
did that have to do with your favorite ?
and how can we draw the force and confidence for our future ?
so , what do we do with the question with the question with the question with the question , what do we do it ?
it 's clear .
technology is r & amp , and developing , even the other federal government 's title , the title of the federal government .
so , understand me .
that 's all great .
and we can be quite proud of that , and it 's grateful in such a lot of fields out of the world that we 're hoping for us to do it .
that we have so extraordinary , unique prosperity .
but what about the future ?
so what challenges are we all being doing is to be a society ?
and who cares , because of the great environmental and social challenges ?
so , it 's kind of a problem of being on .
a kind of a loop .
so the economy is , the ecological challenges , to restore the ecological challenges , because of the entrepreneurs then then get to the amount of effort we then grow and efficiency .
and the world are better , they want to find themselves in nonprofit organizations and then and <unk> and <unk> , and then they have to be so much what businesses are , of course , to avoid the <unk> of the <unk> economy .
at least , at least .
but who says , because of course , we have to look like this as we have to look at it ?
what if we open our dopamine receptor to create social and cultural development ?
when technological innovations are also cultural innovations ?
if economic innovation are also social innovations ?
if we think about finding out of these , and doing it intact to have a universal sector with the solution of creating the solutions to create the solution of a universal and social challenges ?
if all of these , if all of these , unknown to avoid unknown forces , and if there 's a whole other , fair <unk> development ?
because what was that ?
they want to do the pages , right ?
can we do that ?
you may be wondering .
so far , we 've always been accused of this as a member .
luckily , there is some basic examples .
fourteen yunus has given his <unk> , with his <unk> , with his <unk> , in bangladesh , in bangladesh , is about poverty .
and interestingly , much more generally at the direct level of what the government 's <unk> .
and he has <unk> as a entrepreneur , presumably , he 'd be able to get the <unk> <unk> .
i think , i think , i 'm going to do a <unk> label , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
and then , let me think of <unk> <unk> .
now , the sound of the puzzle young is a fake boy .
all right , that 's great , but it also has its ideal rate .
and yeah , so totally <unk> .
i like to love the absolutely .
and if you see that , you think , well , you know , when you think , you do n't worry about our future .
yes , the same thing he did somewhere here is to work on the end of the <unk> witness .
that 's what he makes it all with all .
and that 's what it 's very clear and it 's very successful .
and yet , there 's something happening in it .
so , what 's not there anymore , is it in my mind ?
this is what he 's going to do is he just respond to the <unk> .
so , you know , these are the <unk> , yes , all the <unk> .
and that 's like it too .
and he also like this <unk> .
so the right thing is , as the <unk> , it 's actually found the same .
so he did n't know it , but he 's from the <unk> , he said , `` that 's what he said .
and because of the middle , in the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the t , he
so the more he was perceived to him in the <unk> personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal .
when a <unk> <unk> .
and as an familiar entrepreneur , he realized that he was looking at .
so , the thing that 's very joy about young people , they 're going to work with his experience .
and then the two people would find out the way they were .
and they 've been struck .
so what about this interview we 're going to do is that the two conversations for the two ?
yes , mister <unk> , so i think , like , that 's what it was .
what is the difference between the world 's difference between the world 's life and the <unk> company ?
i did n't understand that .
yes , so then then you start , then you start with the question of what 's useful business ?
so , let 's have a name .
local markets , agricultural products , lots of customer , <unk> structures , there 's a <unk> .
and you can also give you to be able to give you the big shapes .
and once again , the very cool thing , even though , that 's very cool .
so what is a <unk> ?
so , <unk> , you 've got a lot of times not likely to do it , it 's not the little copy of a big company .
it 's something very different .
it has a completely different characters .
because it does n't stop anything .
no pavement , no <unk> , not being known .
so , of course , a <unk> organization is a broken organization that has a business organization to develop a business model , of course , that it 's , of course , is that , of course , is that , of course , and then it 's scale .
and you 're certain understanding that there are so <unk> organization in the other , very different ways , very different ways .
yes , that 's what i 'm clear .
but what are we looking for ?
so , i 'm going to do it , then , you know , to make a really good job of making money ?
so i 'm also doing this , this fits out of this exact upbeat seminar , in berlin , maybe would you like this ?
that 's called <unk> .
like you have a company for your company and after the <unk> your life ever lived .
oh ...
that 's real <unk> ?
what do you think of , if you got 30 , 30 your little money , what 's your strategy ?
so you 're then spending a career as a practical <unk> or what ?
what happens to your commitment , so i know you know ?
and we also have a look at the face of the <unk> .
so the statistics do n't give you a single perspective , because 70 percent of the rest of the world 's total are a few years after that , after a second , a lot of a <unk> , as a result , as the big go .
money is always the result of a successful enterprise and a good society company .
so sure , money is a resource for public care .
and it 's the foundation that 's economic internet .
but it 's never the goal of a company .
yes , what is the target ?
the company ?
so when i do what i do is n't you have to do that , so it 's not a way of the right .
and so , you know , it 's going to be used to be and more likely to be and so forth .
and if i do n't have that all not , so i can not know what to look for me ?
so i do n't think good emotion .
so i want to decide for that , because of the way , and risks , that feels like me and <unk> me .
yes , welcome to the <unk> .
but i do n't know what to you .
a thread .
so that 's where you have <unk> , so it 's almost classified .
successful <unk> of generation is to generation <unk> .
a <unk> tool for <unk> .
so , how do you say today ?
<unk> , do i <unk> ?
so we 're always saying to get this out of it .
by comparison , the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
so , it helps .
i mean , i can leave you one of them .
okay .
yes , thank you , mister <unk> .
but there 's just one on the way it 's questions on it .
so you can see one of the major public public factors , to ask questions .
can we get the other point of the other we get that , maybe i can get that better ?
so the first thing is , what am i trying to get here and do it ?
yes , <unk> , there 's what 's going on , you know , what 's bigger than you are ?
what do you add in the world ?
what are people who have been working on with you ?
what are you ready to give ?
what are your inside , maybe even unconscious ?
why is this so important to see ?
because they are also your <unk> <unk> .
and how did we learn that by all that ?
if you do a ship , then you would not make the men together , and then you 're going to build a hot job of wood to you , but you 'll ask you , you know , after the amount , you have a ship .
yes , good .
so i looked at the next questions .
what is my jet <unk> ?
so what does that mean ?
yes , now you can think your goal really .
they kind of worked in detail , whenever it 's a <unk> , but i 'm going to be a moment you 'll be in front of you , what you do n't want to be in the way .
you really know the story with the pink <unk> ?
it 's close to me .
not ?
so , preaching .
so , look at it .
if you do n't have an pink elephant .
okay ?
would you think about it ?
so , <unk> , do n't have a pink elephant .
boy : it 's hard ?
we do n't have an pink elephant .
you see ?
so we 're going to focus on what we want to do .
so what is the only chance that ?
so about this ?
yes , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know what you want .
so , <unk> <unk> , or maybe the situation on the <unk> .
but think about you .
by the way , what i 'm going to do is a <unk> or a <unk> ?
i have a cop there .
and the way you do the <unk> .
an ethiopian story in this is called <unk> smith smith .
anyone ?
at least , <unk> , what i 'm going to do is <unk> <unk> , to death at a <unk> .
i 'm going to see from the <unk> from you to see what i 'm going to see is , you know , to the time , to the time , to the time , that 's going to be in the way that was living with better .
i <unk> the glass in the urban game .
i mean , what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i was <unk> my <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> smith smith .
oh , yeah , you know , you know , you know , you 've got a picture of opinion ?
now , if you think about the <unk> <unk> , you know , `` a <unk> , '' <unk> , <unk> , <unk> is near the <unk> .
and it 's <unk> .
it 's a game of the <unk> .
the real stuff is a <unk> <unk> ?
and then you know , what 's it ?
did you notice what ?
did anything have changed ?
okay .
okay , and the flower is too .
okay .
so then we 're looking at where the bear has remained .
and being <unk> .
an ethiopian story in this is called <unk> smith smith .
anyone ?
at least , <unk> , what i 'm going to do is <unk> <unk> , to death at a <unk> .
i 'm going to see from the <unk> from you to see my time , and you can see the time capsule at the time , and i 'll have a lot of time to the time .
i <unk> the glass in the urban game .
i mean , what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i was <unk> my <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> smith smith .
and <unk> , what do you do with this ?
so i know , i was also shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i first saw it .
i could n't think it was n't .
and much more shocked , i was going to be looking at it as i was going to be through the head , is it that i was actually going to go from the whole time ?
by my life .
and i 'm going to understand that , i understand , really , really make sense .
to prevent the <unk> to prevent the immediate <unk> , we have to get most of our perception and our <unk> .
but what 's now , what 's happening ?
what is i going to do , and what ?
and therefore , you know , you 're looking at your perception of your perception of some major entrepreneurial quality .
well , yeah , so , you 'll move , and you 'll move next to the next question .
so how could i be here to my goal ?
so , that 's what i think is good .
and the reason i 'm going to do is , and you do n't even know further .
yes , <unk> , there 's good news for you .
and you 're getting more useful than you 've got to know that .
because if you 're clear to you , your inner propulsion , and if you 're going to tell you , you 're going to tell you , you know , it 's going to happen in the inside of itself .
almost automatically .
you 're not going to be able to do that , as a ] , in your mind , that things are going to you .
these are the famous <unk> you have in the shower .
and i 'm going to tell you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know who you could look at who you could do , you know , to be able to get your home .
and you have a big role , too .
so the <unk> bears are the great thing .
<unk> di <unk> , when he did n't know more further , he did the <unk> invited in florence .
and then go to the famous table .
and it 's totally different people .
so scientists , <unk> , politicians , merchants , merchants , merchants , the architects and he had a very intense <unk> .
but not in our present senses , where 's the time , yes , who 's going to get through ?
who 's right ?
but it 's that all of these different things come from these different parts of the world that no way of the rest of the rest of the rest of the things would have been able to do .
well , the next question , what 's i doing , what about the concrete next step forward ?
so you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the successful entrepreneur in the cause is very simple .
instead of doing big and management and so on just on the next step .
because what about uncertainty is that ?
but the ones who are doing this very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very
and if it was nothing , you look at some other step .
and even if the big , they were n't going to have a big , apart , there 's nothing else else .
that 's why you 're clear to that .
that 's where you have the intrinsic security .
and in the rest of all , we learned all the way to the rest of the world ?
though we did n't know that , and it 's not one one ?
now , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , even in children .
so this game is learning that this game is so addiction and this timeless and <unk> and <unk> and so it 's very , very , the fun that you 're in a company is going to play in a roadside scanner .
and that 's exactly the same thing that the uncertainty that can otherwise do as well as it does .
yes , mister <unk> .
so this is all neat to you .
but i do n't know me in the company , i have to change that , and many more generally , you know , many of the career , there 's something happening there .
and for the sake of germany , there 's always such as these common <unk> .
and i think , there 's the politicians who care on for that that changes .
okay , so okay , my boy , come on .
and you can go here down the water .
what do you think , how many people can you ?
ten ?
tens of thousands of them .
ten million ?
look down here .
who are you ?
right , the one .
that 's the way you can change , that you really can change .
or to say , with mahatma <unk> , the change you 're looking in the world is looking in your own .
think of a nice words and large role models , but how to make it work ?
we have a very <unk> , a few of the <unk> on our coffee <unk> .
so helpful in a lot of crises , or if you want to get too small , or if you want to have a <unk> , and you all have to do with you .
and if you ask yourself in such as possible , what 's very <unk> you now , you can feel physically physically , you know .
so , `` oh , '' what you like to do is you just give you on the grass .
and regardless of the end , `` you know , '' you know what you 're really about by this crisis or what 's happening .
so i 'm my favorite thing , if you 've happened to it , it 's at least .
yeah , good .
thank you very much .
and do you really believe that this will be to be on my way ?
yes .
and you see , you know , two things .
first of all , a little <unk> on the regular memory of the <unk> of the <unk> , that 's what your country will be .
because that means your perception .
and the second thing to your inner orientation is to you .
because , you know , you 're looking at how to behave on the other people ,
the future is then just then , then we 're just going to change our own perception .
do you want to do that ?
yes , i 've already think of it .
and thank you mister <unk> .
everything 's good news <unk> .
yes .
what do you think about our <unk> ?
nice .
do n't , or , <unk> ?
and how do we have it here with this <unk> ?
is this a new family <unk> ?
i mean , yes .
clearly .
i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think ,
<unk> is called the word `` madd ''
and that 's what the really really is .
a <unk> from the league of the mistake .
and no , so new <unk> , <unk> .
this is the <unk> .
the moment in the large famous thing is , for a long , a long , name in the large famous famous name .
from robert <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
let 's just <unk> this spirit .
and who knows , it 's going to be from our <unk> of our time , and who 's now , it 's going to be out of our <unk> 's <unk> .
you 're right , i 'm a <unk> .
so , you know , it 's a thing that i 'm going to do with kids and their future , because finally , children are the future .
instead , i 'm greatly covering most of the time .
i spent a great routine of my life in prison .
four years ago , my dad and i posted the program to the <unk> , and started to run the program , entrepreneurship for prisoners ,
we genetically engineer <unk> <unk> that can be used to be able to make them happen to the store either , or find them a workplace that you can feel like that .
so why am i looking at the big mistake so those who did have the big mistake ?
we have a program that 's far not so easy to understand how to sharpen children .
and i would have thought that the <unk> was the last place in the universe i would work .
what do you think about this is the most important application of childhood with the people that we work with ?
we 've found that these are positive role models are often male positive models .
and when you think about it , why it 's so many of <unk> and many of them have gone over there , it 's because it 's because it 's because it 's because it 's because it 's because it 's because he 's got to be drugs or that he 's sitting in jail .
and when a liberating boy believes what he wants to think of his life is not a better idea of how a different life could be because he could n't have any role role models .
and he <unk> his father .
i 'll give you martin .
martin is <unk> of our program .
his father was a silver lining , and he was all the life of hell .
when he was 12 , his mother died and he had his own brother to go to the home .
and there was the <unk> of the big bang .
he was shy and he <unk> and so that sounds perfect .
and then , as a result , as a result , as a brother , a little brother has been <unk> in a football way of this , that 's the ground .
and then , in martin , in martin , the <unk> , the <unk> , he went to the grocery store .
and he got to get it to that day .
and that was what it was .
violence was now at his life as his dad is .
so , how do you know that i 'm just described , continue ?
after childhood , the person who are a lot of unemployed or have <unk> .
they do n't know much different than your illegal activity and their pioneering <unk> .
and then you will leave one day with people in jail , and you 'll just <unk> the way to jail their thoughts , their thoughts , the same way that no longer is capable of .
over what , you think , think of these people , if you 're sitting in jail ?
all of that is not a lot of good .
and they 're better living in the <unk> .
they sell drugs to a higher level , and planning to the store where they could be able to move after the store .
and that leads to 100 percent at risk of <unk> .
that means , every single country in germany will go back to second .
then , it turns out to be people in prison , who really want to change .
but also , you have a <unk> call on top of their forehead .
and there 's <unk> .
and everywhere you come , it 's your first identity .
whether they 're looking at a workplace , whether you want to make new private relationships , you want to make new private relationships , and they 're going to make them happen to this screen that you 're going to do a job into society as infinitely difficult .
that 's the problem we 're .
how do we try to fix this problem ?
what are the quality of property , believe , do you get many <unk> ?
they 're going to be surprised .
they 're <unk> abilities .
you 've got a <unk> system of having a <unk> system , and you have a sense of <unk> , and the <unk> buffet .
just as the topic of the topic , it 's a little bit , otherwise , otherwise , it did n't get on the prison .
these things we want to use a good positive problem .
we 're starting to begin with a comprehensive education system in jail , in prison , in three .
we transmit the basics of entrepreneurship and economics .
every student is his own contradiction and everyone takes a comprehensive <unk> piece of part .
and then we 're going to talk to the people who care about the water chain , where the prohibition chain of their personal relationships and also in a variety of diy media .
what is the best best going on from our program ?
it 's a big range of racing health programs .
we have a <unk> externality in the front of the planet .
a very large range and a lot of <unk> , i like to give you to sign a report .
<unk> gardens of talent and the <unk> of the <unk> , has been very early with a trade company .
he had fun to do business .
he 's been arrested for the first time .
and this lady has not been particularly strange .
true of the opposite .
he 's telling you , he 's got his second job in time .
<unk> , he had been <unk> for the second time .
he then took a therapy of a therapy and then at the end of the <unk> .
and there he was , he can use his local talent for something that 's <unk> .
he 's in september india , then then then then launched his bones for <unk> .
the agency 's good , it can be living in life .
he has done very good news <unk> .
he 's up with me here today .
who likes to talk to you , you want to talk to it .
even back to martin , i told him to the beginning .
martin has a training for a chef , and ended up in his spare <unk> <unk> .
and there is that , and the drugs in the <unk> , it was quite short .
he was working with parallel as a <unk> and a <unk> .
twenty years he did this life .
and he tells you that he 's not suffering on this lifestyle .
one day he would have a guy in a fighter he was being scanned .
and he had a <unk> , and the <unk> it has changed with it , really changed his life .
he learned how to be more force to the more force and to get more quality of life without being able to make drugs or anything .
and he was made by his passion so he was so excited he 'd like to take it up .
and he wanted to be part of the <unk> .
that 's what it did .
and he 's now going to get two years from us to talk to us how to give our participants on your way , because he knows that if you really want the right amount of life , that much more possible than you are in the hand of the hand .
the basis of these successes are the people that they are .
people who come to the people who come to the people who come to the participants in their own participants , to illustrate with their own personal targets .
these are our <unk> that we think of these <unk> talks in our schools are the students that are the most vulnerable to the <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> .
and these are our mentors that our participants are directly looking at right after the time .
and these people take a lot of our program .
one example .
we 're doing a exercise called <unk> .
we then put into the center of the space and we put a big stick on our subjects on one and our <unk> stand on the other side .
and i 'm going to ask different questions .
and every time , if you answer this question , he 's looking at the line .
and here 's what we all have in common is whether we 're sitting inside of prison or outside .
but also , where the difference are .
and one of the things that you 're , is why .
i was raised up in a call social attack , or i had a family transplant , which was in custody of it .
and there 's very few of our participants going on the line and just very few of our cups .
one question i like to ask us all together , the <unk> , i want to ask you .
and i 'm going to ask you to get up .
maybe we can get a little bit of that in the audience .
i can see them .
they all get .
terrific .
thank you very much .
i suppose , `` now , '' you know a question and if you 're going to go back and look at it again , you 're just going to stay otherwise .
that 's kind of our line that we 're now .
i did n't have professional things to the rest of the world i could have been paid .
if you ask this question , please answer .
to be the problem with the world .
and then , of course , any small amounts of happiness has been obsessed with .
to do it with the driver 's not being used to .
okay .
and it 's also happening , perhaps any workforce , it 's really really true to have the end of the very well .
all right .
most of them are .
we have some angels in the room .
that 's wonderful , because i 'm happy .
thank you very much , you can all sit down .
so , in the other way , if we put it on the front of the data , we 'll get a lot of them in the way .
and i 'm also clear how much happiness you have .
happiness with the parents , happiness with the environment that they were growing up with the friends , but also , even a while that you might not have been caught in the edge of the <unk> or even about it .
what are the results of that work ?
<unk> percent of our alumni can find out of <unk> days after their <unk> .
that 's rapidly fast .
<unk> percent have already made them .
one-third of the donor nations were <unk> .
and our <unk> is seven percent .
i 've said , `` the <unk> , '' of seven percent , a decade of <unk> percent .
i 'm a believer .
a $ <unk> area , in <unk> a year , the $ <unk> dollars .
and it 's a beautiful <unk> , <unk> , which has a <unk> of seven percent of the <unk> of <unk> percent for a <unk> .
and as my dad and i had the same test together , we 've been open from pretty much a lot of attention to the same .
i was back to my fancy <unk> in a big corporation .
but i have to tell you , i did n't have a working job in my life .
we 're encouraging our participants to take responsibility .
so what 's going to happen in your life is , in fact , making responsibility to take in your life .
not to hide , not too much .
because this leads to a whole new self and allows it to trust .
and that 's why it makes me very much happy and proud of our participants .
so i have brought you a little video here .
video .
so i was convicted of two years old and eight months because of dangerous <unk> .
i was being used to <unk> the <unk> against the <unk> to three years old and 10 months .
i traded it up with .
so i 've got some of the judgment from two years because of dangerous <unk> .
i was convicted of <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
so , through my own adolescence , my life has been transformed my life .
and what i 'm interested in is , this was the <unk> , which is also made .
because there was my absolute <unk> .
i was n't uncommon , i was almost saying , yes .
i 've got another goals to do .
i 've gone again again to see again .
and you 're going to get some of the consciousness and self-awareness from the gun .
so far , it 's always fixed and fixed goals and then you 're going to stop again in anything .
with the wrong people , and that 's not happening now .
well , the problem is that many of us have no more <unk> when the ones are coming .
the biggest problem is , because then you 're automatically getting out of it to the old step .
you do n't know anything else .
through this <unk> corridor , no one , no matter what 's going to be increasingly hostile , and i just think of myself in the way of thinking about the relationship with problems , about the society that 's been in my previous weeks .
i 've been enjoying from my first wife from my first female .
and for example , six months ago , i signed over with her .
so that means we have a new relationship .
and because i 'm going to have to do it , and many other things have changed .
i 've achieved a lot .
i 'm going to come back in the russian world 's education .
so i 'm now in my art work , i 'm going to say .
i just do a <unk> externality for ballroom dancing .
you really have to realize that there 's very , very many people who are in the way , like my own life , and really , of course , i do n't know , multidisciplinary rules , the <unk> of the people .
i 'm grateful for you to come on the idea that they do so what they do .
i 'm grateful for you to have trouble with security problems and i am extremely grateful that i could be part of it .
of course , of course , of course , of course , the whole people who were in the case .
i 've talked to many people at the front of the camera , and they 've made me back , that 's good , that 's what you do .
and that 's what i 'm doing it .
and for that , i thank you .
come on to jail with us .
each one of them has something that we need .
whether they helped our participants at their participants , if they were to think of as the <unk> of the <unk> , they 're in the national sector .
whether they want to carry our program into a new business , very quickly .
let 's talk to you .
martin burns and i 'm here today .
and you 're very excited to you .
thank you very much .
<unk> , i have <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> in nepal .
in a time i was a <unk> .
you do things like that .
<unk> is poor .
the <unk> .
one week in the bookstore .
there 's a really many possibility today to handle a lot of options .
you can use to avoid that .
anyway , i was also unhappy of flowers .
and my work and so forth with the <unk> .
i mean , i have to talk about <unk> .
and not from real problems .
my problem was <unk> , and i could rather be quite amazing as my life in 10 or 30 years .
it was <unk> .
and i found scary that .
to express it , to make it .
i mean , i had basically <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
you know , you know , humans know .
i was n't really supposed to go on the <unk> trip ?
do i just make me pause ?
or what would i take my <unk> to do it ?
and look what it happened .
which then you 're waiting for me .
that was the idea .
i was <unk> in this era , <unk> <unk> .
i said , `` i said , <unk> .
the missionary system was also even helpful to me ,
you can have <unk> for free the world , in a very good hotels and <unk> the country in a very small way .
but occasionally , occasionally , problematic countries .
developing countries where there 's safe more and say , as about <unk> villages , with god <unk> people who have nothing , as well happiness and joy .
and the only thing about these pictures and sophisticated lives , but a <unk> of a <unk> .
and that was the thing for me after a while .
i was too much i did .
<unk> .
and i found it a little bit more nerdy about me to write a country that i really did n't know .
that 's what i wanted to do .
i wanted to be right now .
to write <unk> paper .
and to get my personal interest .
how about countries are better ?
by people lives with people .
with people living home .
not in the hotel .
and by talking about the challenges and interacting with the problems of people .
and by the people , it works with the people .
at least , the answer i could give me this question .
and i wanted to do that .
and i wanted to make something a little bit about .
i wanted to make a contribution .
doing a little good .
and that feeling it has a sense of me in a <unk> , still further .
i often had a nepal , though , i often have a nepal , and i was fairly touched in the developing world .
until <unk> , there was a <unk> civil war in the world of the world just not only of those orphans but also lots of economic and social issues .
with a $ 1,000 percent of <unk> dollars , nepal 's <unk> dollars in the south country .
and yet , of course , the world 's population is to one of the world 's 20 favelas in the world .
a quarter of the population lives below the line .
nearly one-fifth of the population population has a population of malnutrition .
forty percent of adults can not read and write .
all of these facts are related to many personal stories and experiences that i met on this journey , in a time i was ready to change and open it was for changes .
i want to change it .
and i stood up after my family <unk> in my own native illness made a decision .
i quit my job .
and <unk> me in the aid .
and i 'm also <unk> a new word of the answer that i 've been put on my application .
because they 're just a <unk> .
it 's about a serious story about designing international computing companies .
and not to make a <unk> for a <unk> drone that could be a little bit of a juvenile life , and a gowanus cell is looking for their search .
hi ?
is it still ?
my life was really serious , and good .
at least i thought .
and this answer was a <unk> <unk> .
i was really quite straightforward .
and he 's actually a very emotional response to be a emotional response .
and fortunately , it never finishes .
instead , i used to have this really intense sense of doing what good <unk> .
i used it as a motor to make my own business .
<unk> .
and fortunately , and they have a lot of <unk> and their trial .
a company that basically is what i was looking at then .
and the possibility of a country is a different place to begin .
the possibility to get a country are really .
and by connecting to the people , and work in space and work .
and it 's not somewhere in the way it can be , but in love <unk> .
and then you can get into two words like this .
so , <unk> and <unk> .
that means as much as the location of the way that you can gather good .
that 's what you can do .
so this sounds like doing something a little bit more elegant .
it 's not .
<unk> is a social enterprise business .
we use tourism as a tool for sustainable development .
and then we use more <unk> than a tool for sustainable development .
so , the zoning and the tourism .
because the people who travel with ourselves as they were concerned with the <unk> of the art .
they pay for your journey , like a different nightmare .
but they just travel differently .
they live in <unk> .
and the principle is not too much more stressed , or a lot of <unk> , it 's real <unk> exchange .
social engagement .
and <unk> .
and then we have to have given our participants to be sacrificed and interests in different projects .
we can also have a <unk> tourism model in the regions that otherwise no chance to have a chance of classical tourism .
because simple things are missing .
we can promote sustainable projects .
we can monitor your sustainable projects and pay attention .
so we 're offering us to a hundred percent of themselves .
they do n't rely on fundraising .
and that 's what we 're doing is to do this for our <unk> art .
so , we have <unk> with our work in nepal .
<unk> year , we have our engagement in uganda .
and then , over four years ago , i 've got married and my husband and i have a team as a team of a <unk> question .
do we go on the <unk> ?
or what would if we get bigger ?
if we go to the <unk> ?
if we do n't just become social engagement and sustainable , not only in a way that 's in its own ?
and also the individual <unk> of things ?
or even more interesting individual <unk> .
so this is basically a <unk> business .
a company that looks at the company .
but in other words , the same philosophy of <unk> .
do we want to do that ?
was the next question .
so , is the <unk> new companies ?
we want that .
we love entrepreneurs and their creative companies .
because we are equally .
because we 're talking to the same language .
because we dream the same expectation .
because we understand the challenges .
and so we have a sister for a sister .
<unk> .
and with <unk> , we rely creative companies in their development and the confidence that we support from extraordinary people .
we also talk about the participants , entrepreneur or employee , of creative companies with individual development .
so the personal social and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
and <unk> it 's been preparing for the <unk> .
there 's still a lot of time , again , again , again .
a commitment to a meaningful system has another benefit .
it shows you a relatively short time to where you 're or where you 're <unk> .
wherever you may have more and more empowered .
you may be anxious , you know , to be a little bit , too , too , too , too .
and it 's one of the things you 're doing right now .
make a very moving front of eyes .
it 's the creativity that all of a sudden great .
or , it 's the stones that you 've discovered .
the conventional things can do that you ca n't change .
and the force to change things that you can change .
and you can do a lot of change .
it 's been in very short time .
we know that .
one example .
these are <unk> rock <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
that 's five very wonderful women from uganda .
with sad <unk> and talent .
she was <unk> beautiful , <unk> <unk> for years .
and since a year , nothing happened .
because they just had no market for it .
because they do n't know how to improve the quality .
because nobody said that design might come in question .
we wanted to help these women .
and so in this year , a <unk> system .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
products out of poverty .
they give up a income .
one future .
we went yesterday with the <unk> live .
and we start with a very <unk> construction .
a <unk> <unk> of a thousand <unk> of our women .
the sell you do n't just get them to a year or a half .
but also , this is still a lot larger to do .
this first is just as social function and <unk> in a field .
so who wants to support , can make this , to the purchase of the purchase , you can also travel to the other , and it 's perfectly able to travel directly into the project .
he can travel to the women and <unk> active .
in the long term , we do n't just give five women , but we 're going to give them or a hundred .
and not only in uganda , but also in nepal and in other , in other , we 're going to work together .
so , this is a <unk> , but this is a project from our integrated cycle of projects .
we 're working in all central central areas .
in the realm of a century , and health and the <unk> and the terminal .
because the work in one is just a domain .
what happens to kids if they 're working ?
right .
so we 've started nepal in nepal , in a year , two to this year ,
everything brings up to our cycle .
and the whole thing that makes more sense is to be a given project .
we 're going to put in the various projects that we 're going into .
and the real opportunity then just do is just in the common work .
and i would like to leave you to the conclusion .
and then i 'm going to close your eyes .
`` you know , '' you 're looking at you in africa .
in the rural heart of uganda .
you 're sitting at a wooden seat .
and it 's satisfied and it 's satisfied .
you just have <unk> your winky <unk> .
there was <unk> .
<unk> .
tasty .
the walls are <unk> .
here it is a pleasurable warm .
you 're <unk> out of the window .
and then you see kids on the <unk> <unk> .
her mother feet <unk> the sand .
you 're <unk> on your household bushes .
there 's a thin layer of the <unk> dust .
children are laughing .
`` call , `` call your name . ''
you 're not going to call you that they 're calling you .
<unk> .
you do n't know how to it is .
but you 'll get up to bed .
and the <unk> , they 're going to go , <unk> , <unk> .
at the end of the street , a big tree .
you 're going to meet you with a couple of advice .
in the russian , in the <unk> , in the <unk> , in the shadow of the river , you 'll be sending the new design of their <unk> spirit .
you 'll get your hands and feet .
and then the other women will come to women .
they 're smiling from scratch .
until you get your hat out to your hat .
there 's the tree .
it 's a <unk> .
right , that 's true that there 's internet there yet .
tomorrow <unk> you with your coach .
you 're <unk> .
the exchange of exchange is every time .
it 's also nice to be a nice thing .
you 're hearing music .
and the <unk> of <unk> .
mom <unk> in the <unk> .
she sings a african song .
you 're kind of lazy and happy .
you can make your eyes back .
each of us can be able to get the barrier to the <unk> movement on something new ways .
or at least a little time , the mallifert encounter it starts to throw new .
and so , what happens .
thank you .
before i start , i would be interested in that , because of you tonight , that you 're here , there 's someone 's <unk> house .
i do n't see the light of this light , but maybe someone else .
here you see , `` i 'm a guy . ''
two .
here , i do n't , but anyway , two , two , two , that 's beautiful , we 're already <unk> .
i also have a building , and that 's the break mountain of the city .
that 's the building .
together with 20 people , i have been occupied in the last summer six months .
and so , let me tell you a night here today .
well , now , you might have to say , well , maybe some of you might say .
what should it be ?
<unk> there is a lot of .
but i want to explain a little bit about this .
oh what , you 're going to do the maintenance system ?
and then you put in the park or what ?
just a small choice of asking the question that we know , friends , sad have learned when they were taught , i was part of a initiative that i 'm called to , something <unk> names , <unk> .
and all of those things were we used to have a range of the <unk> <unk> .
and here about these fountains <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and sent them .
and to make the privatization of this desire .
but who knows me , that 's not my way of the genome .
and it was n't the primary services to the health initiative .
what we see here is a sign from the <unk> side of a <unk> passage in <unk> .
this is a public space that 's just private , and therefore for many people do n't have to do it , but not in public hand and therefore , it 's not used to be used , and therefore not as used to public spaces .
we were a group of <unk> <unk> in the desire with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and it 's <unk> and <unk> .
and we wanted to tell a different <unk> .
we were a <unk> team , and we have to see this very quickly because it was a very uplifting team .
so , from the broad architecture , urban social -- -- politics -- and <unk> <unk> , statistics , design , photography , photography , <unk> and <unk> .
and of course , with different social and personal contribution .
our perspective <unk> and <unk> .
and we can use that up to different skills , but also , in various ways .
and creative has to have been creative , and we have the projects to realize the way forward .
we actually questioned the decision to occupy .
however , it was that we were looking at the disconnect with stories and ideas .
we have started to memory and paintings .
and from these memories and pictures , i tried to develop possible perspectives for the targets .
and it was really important to be bent with this process .
we 've been discovering ourselves as a benign and a <unk> and more successful .
so , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and became a <unk> .
so on the experiences we 've done , we have started to go to the evening .
every city has its own places .
and one of the neighborhood would be a face .
in many cases , this has been <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in the series of citizens as foreign places .
they 're the dead places of a city because they do n't really be the way to what we expect in a public space .
so for example , we have <unk> , for example , have .
they 're in the urban spaces that are in the same way that are in the urban spaces , that will happen to be a frequent .
now , initiatives that people want to revive , often , <unk> issues are already in the infancy .
what did it have to do with me , some questions here like some of you .
i mean , a lot .
these places , in the city , not only one face .
no .
they 're the social places in our city that 's living in our social lives .
so we often get some first time to our neighbors when we meet ourselves from the way to the store .
and can this dive , if we have a whole way to sit in , and actually stop when the spaces are designed .
and we just make our <unk> <unk> .
and we 're getting out of it , sometimes we have a lot of , sometimes .
but what about security is a sense of community .
the more things i do is that in such a public space , the faster and the more , it 's also happening .
and when i do n't <unk> me , it arises that you 're going to call the rocket 's construction .
we then then , two challenges .
we can be conscious in the citizens , responsibility and dedication for their neighborhood or the <unk> , and the <unk> are <unk> .
how can a nuclear sector be transformed ?
how can these things be being transformed into ideas ?
feats versus the privatization and the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> and criticism of the human rights and the <unk> of the world and the state of the world 's not booming , and it 's not surprising <unk> in the same places .
so imagine that you 're sitting here , you beat the newspaper , and i want to read the newspaper .
love explorers and citizens , we store , we invite them three possible varieties for the ministry of the financial <unk> that was <unk> <unk> .
you can choose to the idea of the idea of the idea of a message .
and the cost of the world 's <unk> will be done in action .
would you go ?
would anybody go to this event ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounds great .
there 's a way of a button .
they 're allowed to think of the <unk> of the future .
and as i said , it sounds great about the first moment .
i 'm going to attempt to do it with a explanation .
and that 's because i 'm not really not going to really trust it , or you have a common , <unk> .
one , more ancient <unk> , a lot of late <unk> .
that means , you 're not a method , really to do it really to make your ideas or to have some of the fundamental alternatives , but there 's actually going to be design and they can decide whether they 're immature or <unk> in urban water plants .
or , like a friend , which color color , which color color gave the trash for an example .
second explanation , ancient <unk> is not about information and by peril .
think about three <unk> of stuff .
we 're going to show you what we want to do , and they 're allowed to do it .
frustration and my doctor are often the most of the implications of what i find is somehow understandable .
i do n't want to make sense of <unk> or <unk> if i really prefer to have a better ticket , or maybe the <unk> would have had .
but it 's also different .
despite the fact that we have given the dna of our dna , many conversations have been happening , we learned a lot of <unk> experience .
and we want to share with experience and i want to share that for other things .
i want to share with other initiatives , other projects , but also , or mainly in the world , and of the politics .
because the ones that are supposed to do is actually , and that 's what they should be in the same way for these things .
and if the really thing is that interest in a physics , as often denial and stress , we need to get the new <unk> .
and not even though i 'm also able to do it , but also , you know , that you 're sitting here today .
and that 's why i 'm getting out of designing for a very important way .
i think it 's important for what they 're all going to go , and i want to give you to give you to give you to our blueprint , the <unk> .
and i do n't know what they 're doing , because they are the ones who can play with a new <unk> .
so we have to feel safe to the citizens of consciousness , responsibility and dedication to make responsibility and to implement and tapped ?
first , for example , to be <unk> .
in <unk> , you have <unk> <unk> , citizens on <unk> and different interests .
what we see here is a <unk> we asked to .
what we see here are some <unk> and <unk> in the conversation with citizens .
the goal has to be , all these conversations are happening on battle , so that not the most common interest or the <unk> abilities of the people who are the citizens .
the citizens on the ground , experts , they 're experts for their neighborhood to know what they are missing with a place where tradition is a place and also , what they do before .
the <unk> , especially in the city , to be able to translate to the city , to the project .
in the case , in a particular case , you can have more <unk> , the themes that are the only thing that are forced on the project depending on .
this is what all of the things that you do is to have the place to all the accessible is to all the accessible and the point of the place .
by maybe , can be able to be able to be able to get some distance to this place .
it 's a dialogue in battle means that the wishes of the residents are actually serious .
and then when someone says , i want to get a <unk> next to the one side .
and of course , that 's what it can be , but the goal has to be , in the other way with all the time , what is the right answer , and maybe in the <unk> , the <unk> , but maybe a different place .
as i said , this is something that has to be made out of the dialogue .
second point is several <unk> .
our <unk> is a <unk> .
one feels totally obvious when he 's faced with a great group , and talk about .
another can do n't want to do it , but the text is not going to talk to the <unk> of the <unk> .
another might might be a rather idea or photograph .
or build his ideas in <unk> <unk> .
what i want to say is to be different modes to make different targets .
we have the possibility to be just so , and then , what happened .
in the background , small show in the background ,
we have the possibility to give up .
we have the possibility to paint .
we have been the possibility to write .
regardless of the age .
that was a <unk> girl .
we had the possibility to connect our ideas with faces ideas .
plus the possibility outside of <unk> <unk> , it should be given .
that can happen for example , which can happen in a video game .
the <unk> and transparent rates of results we have <unk> the dialogue under the ground .
we have given the whole process of our facebook and the whole process , and at the same time , <unk> <unk> over a <unk> distributed .
our third point is <unk> .
you may remember that i said that ikea is often too late .
in my rose event , there was three seconds old phone .
but the process is that , but it 's only when it 's a molecular problem , and the certainly in the conventional self wo n't know what to do with the appropriate area .
if through the conversation , and so i 'm again going to be a moment , you know , you know , that 's going to be a place that 's going to happen for a place .
<unk> also , by the way , is also the <unk> .
and then when it 's not at the end of the detector that the bush-kerry event and so forth , it 's made out of the experiences from the previous market .
what happens now when citizens and their city is falling around and their city .
already , you know , is already in a lot of projects .
i have a example of <unk> here , which is the <unk> , is probably in many here .
in new york , a project started , there 's a <unk> .
in <unk> grass , there are <unk> dollars in six weeks , the funding are possible to be able to do , or at least <unk> .
so , the time has allowed to do the world , the politics could n't have different than the idea to their own .
and the <unk> in new york , i do n't say , because he 's in the world 's point of the world 's point of the city , was not a one-time idea of politics or administration .
in the opposite , the <unk> movement is stuck in the <unk> .
in <unk> , so we 're back again , and we 're back to the production of a certain way again , again , again .
the city had never been told before .
the four weeks <unk> , which we have <unk> , the money are totally than <unk> .
today 's the <unk> of the city .
while the site of literacy is wonderfully wonderful , and the city has the <unk> , the initiative that started to come up and other <unk> .
in the end , the street would be sending their own homes on the street .
in rotterdam , a <unk> <unk> .
all right , all right , you want to say .
and then we 're just going to do so on the end , and then we 're just going to do that .
but i think it 's wrong for wrong , the city of the responsibility .
why ?
one , because you have a look at it , you know , you should have a look at it .
while the research , it 's citizens men 's initiatives , or businesses in the rule of a grain of time , in any form of conflict , the city has been responsible for projects that are also the point of attention .
and , of course , the city of the city is going to go to the projects , other means for people .
a <unk> initiative can put this just to the sun .
and the goal was that , by the way , a temporary initiative was a temporary initiative that was planned for her school , about half a year and the responsibility to the city .
it 's been a <unk> of the world 's break in january .
it 's still getting negotiation .
so we have the problem we did n't want to get the responsibility to the problem .
but we now know that if the city will continue to be successful in the afterlife , if the negotiations are actually successful , then you 'll be a <unk> .
and in fact , in whatever form , it 's still open .
and to end , i believe that many of the projects that are convinced of their importance of their meaning , complexity or also , of the cost of the city , we have to be able to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to
if they 're just in time with the citizens who are expelled to .
in each other , and citizens .
in the city of town , and you all are sitting here today .
if we demand our way to demand and at the same time , the <unk> of the citizens , the citizens of the citizens are not like , but as a <unk> .
that 's it .
yesterday , the <unk> was , we were in <unk> in <unk> in <unk> in <unk> in <unk> in the <unk> and the same one .
we 've talked about <unk> .
so this idea , even more at this life , it 's just a second chance .
we found really exciting .
and we were quite very quickly that there was two things we did n't want to see .
one is adolescence .
the second thing was , was happening on the table , even in school ?
no way .
no way .
school , some of you might remember the same thing .
it 's because of it now , the most of the <unk> of this is the most novel years , but the words are going to come to me immediately .
my neck would stand together and i just want to get back to it .
and then i do n't know how to do it , but in my graduate exam , then the thing that i kept on the <unk> of it was coming next to me .
no idea what it is in the state of that .
you 'll understand , my school , my high school was really not beautiful , and after i had my last <unk> , i had never clear , never again .
and what i 'm saying now when i put on the year , some of the most beautiful days i spent a time ago , i spent schools .
with a great desire and it 's appropriate .
what did it come from ?
so how could this happen ?
and that just started to do that , that something happened , i could n't even calculate .
i got kids .
so my wife got the children .
and so then also , it was very clear that it 's the one that had to take to care of these <unk> .
and when she said , it 's <unk> .
and you 're going to leave you today .
yes , <unk> .
and i opened the door , and i was sitting in this <unk> and i 'd blow up , i felt invincible in the cafeterias .
and that looked exactly what it looked like on us .
and the <unk> i 'm also as high as high as high as high as high as high as high as the street as a <unk> , and i 'm <unk> , and i 'm sorry , and i 'm really interested in here .
and when i heard the teacher , and you know , the kids do n't learn the school for the school , but for some life , i 'm sorry , oh my god , the sentence , i did n't care at that time .
what is this , what we did from school , from the school , from that time , in fact , is they actually made ?
so many of us have learned a really good learned .
so where did you think of that in your life , you 've got good things well ?
and maybe some of the capital of the capital is being used to be <unk> .
what is even more mature ?
or <unk> , this ability to have a very much better knowledge , just , so i can <unk> it on the verge of a <unk> and <unk> until i get bad for ?
good , i took it for the <unk> , but otherwise ?
and what does a <unk> of a point of a point of someone who will be a good doctor ?
so if the person is , is the cost of good things ?
no way .
so , no way , for the life , not for school , we 're learning .
if we look like this , it 's about <unk> years , in the middle of the world 's century , that 's what it 's voted .
this is the time in germany , that has been published in germany .
and where the system we 've got today has his root .
and when we imagine the time back then , it was actually that people had no access to know the knowledge of time .
and there was this four or six years that they were forced to go to school and to know where they were , and then they were really the only way that the ones that knowledge and the facts and the information and the information and the information and the information of your time .
today , a more more information has more information in its pocket than the largest library of the time .
and the second , the time , that was the time of the monkey .
that means , there 's a lot of changes in the world , and there suddenly people need to have these new machines .
but in the same time , also people needed these machines and repair them .
and we needed people to build these machines and the ones that we could blow them into the same way .
maybe it 's it .
the <unk> system that we have in germany now has his root in this time .
and it 's really a sense of it .
and it was probably that it was probably that , what i 've learned in school for the work , i think of who are on the assembly line , the stood in the end of the day .
let 's see a lot of the future .
let 's take the <unk> century where it is , and let 's look at the year .
the year <unk> was that the year was a first working on a little bit of time ago before .
i was finished with my graduate school and thought now , now , now , now you 're going to do it , the first company .
yes , after some of you , the internet , after some of you , i 'm looking at the internet , i 'm going to do that , and i 'm going to do that now .
and some of them are <unk> on us , and they have been getting bigger and less slow , and we 're getting so nice slow , and some of the companies are getting so slow to us , and some of the companies are going to get back to us back in free .
you 're always seeing two times two times .
and we had a couple of years , and then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then
so , we had such a beautiful growth , and we had this kind of exciting job on board like <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i do n't know if they 're concrete concrete , what these people do when i was in high school , we had no idea that there was going to be so much .
even when i was <unk> , and i was doing not a talk about what the internet was .
and the children that we 're going to do today in the school now is that the job in 10 , six , 20 or 30 years ?
the only appropriate answer is we have no idea .
and what you know , what are the facts are going to be successful in these future jobs ?
and if they 're honest , and the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we 're going to be like this to be in the future who might be the <unk> for the machine .
there 's some <unk> <unk> , and i read .
well , you see , you have no idea .
so how do we get out of school as high as i think ?
what are the things that we need to make children get to life ?
and maybe it 's what we 're looking at is what companies are looking for about what companies are looking for .
that 's the <unk> facility , right ?
the graduate schools of schools and universities are going to come into the company .
and if you look at this as a result , if you look at what 's going on , you know , there 's something that 's what the expertise is , as you can see the expertise .
so that 's what the things would want to do , we 're going to look at the beginning to the <unk> <unk> , and 12 years ago in the house .
so this will be done in school and too , too , in the future .
but what could be done , the things that are always important , these are the ones that are made that , and i 'm firmly convinced that this is the short establishment that will be the short regrets of the future .
and you can just sum into the principle in three different groups .
this is to one , companies will have employees , the flexible , so that 's one thing .
and then almost all of the companies think of <unk> thinking .
and then these companies want to get together , the <unk> .
so we think of an organization and the <unk> .
let 's start with the laser .
that 's pretty clear understood .
so if we look at how economics works , how much as you can understand how the speed of it works , how quickly changes .
<unk> , all of the things that are going on all business models , the internet is going on on the back of the internet today .
there i have to deal with this change with this change .
there 's no one i met employee , the creative ones .
there i have to go out of silence , the <unk> .
that 's pretty accurate of what the factory was in the factory of the <unk> century of employees in the assembly process .
and the second thing that 's true is that the <unk> of the world is quite clear .
there 's the responsibility .
there 's people who are struggling to .
first of all , for itself , and your own life .
but also for the big stuff .
whether it 's the company or a society we want to take us to embrace the responsibility of the big stuff .
and the third factor , the <unk> , which will almost be most likely to be most of the most common <unk> .
and if we remember the football , the beautiful adage in the internet .
it has <unk> <unk> , and germany has a team .
it was n't a <unk> <unk> who won the world .
and that could happen in common .
and also someone who 's been looking at this great poet of our time , steve jobs , yes , <unk> .
it was n't the same iphone , which did n't invented the <unk> , who did n't invent the <unk> , who did n't invent the <unk> .
and the team of a team that could do that could have done because it was only as a team that could make them .
so , in school , these three things that are going to happen to the point of the <unk> , in which we learn to be living for .
but there 's still more accurate , and it 's almost more important .
and that 's what learning itself .
if the only thing we can say about the future of security , is that it 's not spiritual , but the ability to learn to learn to the challenge of that , we have to live in the future , and that our children are succeeding in the future lives .
and the point of the <unk> , which is what they communicate .
but where was i ?
i was sitting in this <unk> and the one who know that this is not exactly the thing that you have to pay for .
so , in the case , it 's still said , but not one of them .
until that moment , where <unk> are elected , then , suddenly , all of the invisible .
yes , i was sitting there , and what i should say , at the most u.n. , one of my kids were , that still was the funniest parts of the event .
less fun , it was as a parent , if if that 's like the subject to talk about the subject , and learn the whole <unk> house .
and even less fun , when the child becomes sick , because in the schools of stress .
and finally , this <unk> <unk> or a peak of this <unk> <unk> at this school also again <unk> .
and it was n't a <unk> , it was rather like a <unk> , so that was right after the last hour and in reality , we were also the only parents who were invited .
and i 'm looking at this thing , and my own detail was clear at the time , and i 've been clear with our child , and we have to be assuming we had to be there , that 's not all the way .
but two years in which we 've studied , there 's something that works .
what do we do ?
and we had a question to be the question , was we broken it ?
and are we the only one that go ?
now , in the last two years , i 've been talking about this topic in the subject , i 've learned to be in the issue , i 've learned to be a lot of people , you 're not alone .
there 's a lot of people who get it all over , and that was two years ago , and i was able to have started to have a new business where the journey was coming , and at the bar , we sat on the bar and we sat on private things .
and what should i say , he almost told me almost the same story with one of his kids have almost the same story , and we had the lucky one , and we had the same thing we could get away from school from school , yes ?
in berlin , there 's a <unk> of different schools in berlin , and we could even consider <unk> .
but can you do that ?
somehow , we did n't have to bring our children in security and to leave that out out there .
and after we both have the idea that we were n't that we were in , we 're the first one that we have done .
so how do we change as we have something different ?
the good news is that we 're going to have to think .
we 're not alone .
but we 've been relatively fast at all , all the number of amazing people , who did like that , which is what we wanted to do , which is what we wanted to do is to do with that , to create the way that we want to do , `` the ] we want to do that , to do that , to be able to do it , to be
it 's not that just the children and their parents under the suffering , which is there 's a frequent thing .
if we look at the teachers , 30 percent of teachers have <unk> .
if we look at how the number of <unk> period over the last 10 10 years has changed .
so can all the parents make whatever wrong ?
that all the children are broken broken and that teachers are broken ?
or , of course , we have a school system that just does n't happen , like this <unk> <unk> years ago , that fits it to do n't even do n't work .
and we 've found lots of people who have found it similar to the end and we 've had people who have no children .
and they understood that they have to take responsibility for the future , by providing responsibility , which we have to take responsibility and the kids that are going to go to school with the road .
and we have a lot of time to <unk> here , there are all over great initiatives to be able to change school , and there 's <unk> schools here , and there 's <unk> schools , and there 's a great <unk> , and there 's almost a great job , and there 's almost a great job , and there 's almost a great job , and there 's almost a great job , and it 's almost like a result of the rest of the rest of the rest of the world 's disease .
and it 's even one or other bold , and then you can see the first step .
and how should we help as a more hunting ?
we had no concept that we could now help them happen .
but we can go to the schools , and we can go to these schools that are the parent , so the parents , the teacher and the students , and we can move in two days .
so , there are people who are capable of that in the past , and they 're learning learning in two days , which is what it means to work .
they 're coming with <unk> 's really smart challenge that they 're doing in .
and after two times , the new drug crisis , the real estate gave a new drug crisis , or the real estate for a local school , as we can just give you to a local school .
or the most intelligent things for the <unk> of the problems that they have in school .
within two days , some new ways that are instantly going to be implemented at the next day ,
but what 's the scariest thing about this two days , and that 's what it 's going to do is so nice to spend the few weekends that i 've got , and then even even in schools in a very germany , this energy is coming from the three things .
when three things are in common , which is what the criminal tree <unk> .
so , as you can see , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , and you
and then this is a piece of a piece of piece of a piece of a piece of consciousness .
and when we have a lot of the time we 've been doing four weeks after we have a deeper workshop , we 've started to get back to school , we 've started to realize that there was totally new culture .
and that 's incredibly hot .
and i 'm going to think of it in love to think about school .
i 'll <unk> you , thinking about school .
and i 'm calling you all of the things about school , and talk about school .
and talk about what you like , but what you do , you know , what do n't you like .
they 're going to be surprised as much as you get , and how many people have the same thing , but not one about them .
let 's bring us every single school in germany .
let 's change the whole system system .
and let 's do that in common with the people who care for the school , with the parents , the teachers and the students .
because we can do that .
thank you .
